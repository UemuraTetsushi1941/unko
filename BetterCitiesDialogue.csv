"Our new Honored Citizen! You have done so much for the County and the City of Leyawiin that I, Count Marius Caro, at the request of the respectable citizens of the city..."
... confer upon you the title of Honored Citizen of Leyawiin City and County! Bear this high title with honor.
And may every Leyawiin citizen be grateful to you. This Diploma will confirm your status if someone does not recognize you by sight.
"And this warhammer bears the name Hammer of Justice. It served our ancestors, now let it serve you. Glory to you, Honored Citizen of Leyawiin!"
Hello!
"I don't speak to low-lifes like you, now take this gold piece and don't drink it all at once!"
On your way now. Leave me be. Shoo!
Can't I get any peace around here?!
"Elizabetha has told me about your desire to talk about my wife. I don't see that it is any of your business, but I am willing to talk about it."
You again? What now?
"So, you're the one who gathered the evidence, is this right?"
"We have him! I have forced the ogre mage to return to his human disguise for now, it's easier for us to manage him this way, less physical strength."
You were victorious then?
Please don't kill me!
"Ha! I knew it! You can stop crawling around in the chambers, I've opened the door!"
"Alright, alright. You opened the door. So what? what difference does it make? After all, we are partners! Let's go! Go on!"
What? By the gods! I thought you were that beast again! I hope you left the rope hanging?!

"No blood, no spell will lead you out of here, mortal. You will have all time to wait and understand."
"I see. There is the chosen one, to end this old fuss between king and mage. Have you already recovered the Blade of Namira? Have you already become the last mortal who gained the knowledge about Ruun? The realm that was once cursed by its own king?"
Do you have the book?


Yes? What's up?
"You take the right one and I the left one. They lead into a large hall, I'll meet you there. And be careful. Yours is full of traps."
No! Don't wait for me! Go through the gate before it closes! Go ahead! Do it! I know far more spells than you! Now go!
"Have you lost control of your body?! With your blood and my power, I will create an empire on the ruins of the Akatosh..."
Yes? What's up?
Haven't you learned your lesson more than once? You stupid fool! Do you really believe you can hold me from my destiny?
You needn't be afraid of the flames. You'll suffocate before they burn you.
You dull the pain. You bring him oblivion.
Oh... hello.
You should speak to my husband.
"Very good, you have unlocked the Silver Gate. This really is MOST exciting!"
"I shall start to put together a camp in the next chamber, in anticipation of the Guild's expedition party."
Once you've confirmed it's all safe of course!
Well... this certainly is not what I was expecting. I think I'll just remain right here. Do let me know how you get on!
"I think you have the wrong room! At least, I hope you have the wrong room, you look quite capable of violence."
"Well, I'm glad we've been able to help this family, perhaps one day someone will write a book about this tale!"
"Do let Elaine know too, if you haven't already. Now I really must return to the cavern, hopefully my assistants have arrived while we've been away."
I left them a note to have the dead adventurers brought up to the surface for proper burials. I'll see you down there again when you're ready.
"Ah, good, you found your way here too!"
Did you hear it too? There was a voice calling [QUOTE]we are free[QUOTE]. One of my assistants was here just a moment ago confirming that they heard it in the first chamber. She also told me that the ghosts have all disappeared.
"It all went wrong. Everything, went wrong."
"I feel that the end is near, and I'm scared..."
"A mortal? How did you manage to get here? Ah, the Crow book. Well, one who deserves one gift is worthy of another."
"So, it's over?"
"There is already a lot of gossip in town about me and Olivia. I will be able to justify the death of this worthless necromancer, thank Talos, but this is not enough."
Revenge! Revenge! Why did you kill him! I will have my revenge! Revenge!
"What's troubling you this time, child?"
Olivia Valerius's voice is still weeping over the city... She is suffering and angry. She is suffering.
(Remains silent)
Revenge! Revenge! REVENGE!
What are you doing? Don't you understand how hard it is for us? I'm tired of waiting... Damn Elendar. This is his fault!
Are you back already? And what did you learn? Did you manage to find out something? I'm very curious...
You! Why are you here?!
"Greetings to the new Knight of the White Stallion. I am the Order's quartermaster and head of the Leyawiin Armoury. Aloysius Strumpf, at your service, sir knight."
(Remains silent)
Don't come near me! Murderer!
My child. I can see the sadness in your eyes and a cry for help. And I hear a voice calling out to me. The voice of a woman.
You... I can speak. Talk. I... Where am I? Why am I here? Who are you?
Why do you always bother me? Is it really hard to understand that I don't want to talk to anyone?
It is so cold always. Elendar walks around every night yet he cannot hear me. I'm afraid.
Stop! Stop! What are you doing here? What are you looking for in my house?
You again. Now I can see you clearly. And I remember everything that happened to me. What do you wish to know?
I don't even know if I'm glad to see you. Probably not. But I'll wait and see what you have to tell me.
Hush hush. The tests are over. It's all over. Calm down. Catch your breath. That's all.
"Good health. I wanted to ask, they say you help people? Will you help me?"
What are you staring at? Nothing to do?
"The Trans-Niben company is glad to welcome you and offer its services. Trade, delivery of goods and correspondence, other services."
How can we help?
Wait! Wait! Are you looking for my uncle?
"Excuse me, could we have a little chat?"
At last! We were getting terribly worried. What happened? Where are the documents?
You! You dare come in here? Get out! Go away!
At last. What happened? We were starting to worry. Where are the documents?
"Oh, it's good that I met you. I hope you can help me with Greyland again?"
Have you any news about Greyland?
"Oh, it's you. I want to offer you a bit of work."
"You're new? Where'd you get the goods? At the port, right? What do you want?"
What have you learnt?
"No, no! Don't kill! This one is not to blame! This one knows nothing!"
Just think! They dared to attack us. Do they really have no brains at all?
"Hello, you look very concerned about something?"
Did you find Ri'Shar?
"Hello, you look very pleased about something?"
I feel terrible! Ohhh...
It's you again. Good. Let's get down to business.
"We are glad to welcome you to the village of Sleepy Creek, traveler."
Who are you? Go away. You have nothing to do here!
"Child, you are again filled with anxiety and doubt. And you turn to me again for advice. How can I help you, restless child?"
"There is so much fog around.... But the light is breaking through. When there is light, I see Elendar. And you. I see you again. And I hear you. What do you want?"
Where am I? I sense life nearby. Close... Where are you? I'm scared.
Memories... my memories...
Memories... my memories...
(Remains silent)
"Tsavi is worried. Tell her it's okay, huh? Tsavi's fur stands on end..."
I hope my wife found peace? I can't take much more of this. Everyone is talking about me and my family.
"We've found a shipwreck! The crew are busy stowing the mainsail, would you row across to the wreck?"
Oh no! The pirates have returned!
"Please, take us back to your ship now, we need food and water!"
"You're back, I see. And what of the delivery?"
"It's all over, lawbreaker!"
Morning sunshine.
Won't you sit down?
"There now, this is much more civilised than talking through the bars of your cell."
Hi there my young friend. I'm so happy to see you.
What's happening here? What did you do to my wife?
So good to see you again.
I do hope you'll see your aunt Vana soon.
"Hello nephew, don't you have to be in Bruma now?"
"Hello niece, don't you have to be in Bruma now?"
I am so pleased you came to visit again! Your aunt Vana was just saying yesterday how sorry she was that she missed you last time.
Did you learn anything more about the plans of the rangers for these ruins?
"You haven't cleared the aqueduct yet, there is still a blockage. What is stopping you?"
"The aqueduct isn't clear yet, what are you trying to do, kill me with your lies?"
"The aqueduct isn't clear yet, what are you trying to do, kill me with your lies?"
"Don't talk to me until you clear the aqueduct, now get out of my sight."
"Ah, finally, the people of the Imperial City can drink the sweet waters of the spring once again. Thank you for all that you have done."
"By the way, if it was not rubble blocking the stream, then what was it?"
Why anyone lives here is beyond my comprehension.
Are you talking to me? I don't know you! So keep moving!
Haha. Joking. So what are we up to?
Great. You stepped in rat-shit.
"I'm hungry. And frankly, you look emaciated too!"
"Take a look at all the things you're carrying around with you. Say, will you still need this if something happens to you?"
"Ey, I know a guy in the city, he would pay me a great price. Let's give me more things and I'll go see him while you wait here."
"What's that smell? Hey, why don't we go find a bath house? You take a bath and I take a girl - so we both benefit!"
At work?!
Bravil! I love Bravil! The dirt! The filth! The rabble! The Count's loose hand...
"Oh, and Marwen. Let's go to Anvil instead."
Go away! I don't even know you!
Why are you talking to me? Buy yourself something better to wear!
"Oh, Mara have mercy on my eyes. I am blind! I am blind!"
You have skin like onion leather! Seeing you will make anyone howl!
Just don't take your eyes off me!
There you are again. And? Have you reconsidered?
I'm just standing here and amusing myself. Why? Would you like to help me with this?
I've seen all shapes and sizes. But that's a really nicely crafted blade!
"You know who I am and what I do here. So go ahead, move on. Save a few damsels in distress or slay a few dragons, or whatever you do out there, and let me do what I need to do."
"No, I'm working here! So move on. If someone sees us they might think we belong together!"
I don't go for people who are from here. I might as well nail myself to a gibbet!
"Are you the courier? I've been waiting for ages! Quick, give me the package so I can get back to work."
Well? What do you want?
"Hmm, erm.. what? Oh my!"
You have the package? Hand it over.
You have the package? Give it to me!
"Here's the package. Now, get out of here!"
You have the package? Good...
"Now, prepare to die!"
"Oh, there you are. Here's the package."
"Finally you're here! Here, take the package."
"I'm a busy man, what do you want?"
"You be on my ship now kid, so you abide by my rules! I don't want yeh touchin' anythin', or go breakin' anythin'! Stay out o' me men's way, and yeh'll be fine in my books."
"Enjoy my ship while yeh can, we set sail fer Southpoint in a short while."
"I've got to get me some new shoes! The ship aint as young as she used to be, an' the splinters are gettin' unbearable!"
"Oh aye, I think I overdid it with the mead last night... ohh, mah achin' head."
"Ohhh... ohh, please, don't talk so loud..."
"Oh bother, I can't find it anywhere!"
"Oh, oh hey! Hey, did yeh find mah feather yet?"
"Oh aye! How's it goin'! I haven't lost mah feather again yet, but it's only a matter of time."
You don't look like the sailin' sort! What're you doin' down 'ere at the port?
"Ohh, nothin' quite beats bein' a sailin' man, I go with the wind whenever I can."
"Oooh, I met a fine young lass down at that tavern last evenin'! I almost wish I could take 'er with me when we go teh sea! A bit o' company would go down well on the long nights."
"Greetings! We may not have the cleanest or the driest place in town, but I'll be damned if you can find better food or drink!"
Care for a drink?
Can't you bother me some other time? I'm winning!
"Damn it, I'm down ten septims already! Okay, just one more round, and that's it..."
Hey! No peeking!
I haven't won a single round... I swear everyone else is cheating...
"Mmmm, smell that? That sweet sea air, how I long to be sailing amongst it once more, instead of being holed up in this blasted port..."
I asked to be left alone.
"We sure have been stuck in Leyawiin for a while now. I hope the captain gets his orders soon, or I may have to desert to a better ship."
"Oh my, is that the Tender Topal?! Oh, how horrible..."
The poor captain... I feel terrible for him.
I'm so bored I could just punch you in the face!
Would it kill them to give us a deck of cards or something?!
"Woah, that's the Tender Topal? What on earth happened to it?!"
"Wow, losing his sister must have hit hard for the captain... I wish there was something I could do to cheer him up, but I guess the best thing is to just leave him be."
"If this ship doesn't leave port in the next few days, there is going to be a full-scale mutiny! I haven't seen the crew this itchy since that case of Serpiginous Dementia we all came down with."
"I saw the Tender Topal before she left port, and she was a magnificent ship... what a shame."
I can't imagine what the captain is going through right now... losing his sister must be terrible...
"I swear, being holed up in this ship all day is driving me insane! I just want to burn the damn thing down and dance on the ashes!"
How could anyone have survived that?
"That poor old man, he misses his sister so very much... it's just horrible thinking about what those pirates must be doing to her."
"Twelve thousand, eight hundred and... wait, what? Who are you? Argh! I lost my spot! What do you want?!"
"Thirteen hundred and seventy... huh, what? ... ARGH!"
Can't you see that I'm a little busy here? Why don't you go bother one of your other street urchin friends and leave us to our jobs.
And there will be a shipment coming in on... Turdas... make sure Port Two is open to allow them to dock... hmmm? Who are you?
"And that shipment of silk will be coming in on the second Sundas... hmmm? Oh, you again, what do you want this time?"
"Ohh, darn it, now I've smudged the ink! What do you want, or are you just going to stare all day?"
"Do you have any idea how busy I am? Well, out with it, what do you want? I don't have all day, and these requisition forms won't notify themselves!"
"Oh, a visitor? Surely you're not here for me, I never get any visitors unless they want me to do something! This was supposed to be a family business, but you'd never know it."
You again? You're becoming my most frequent visitor up here.
"What are you doing up here? You shouldn't be in here! Go on, get out! And don't leave any mess behind when you go! The maid just swept this place, and she costs a bundle to hire."
"Stay away from the Company's ships, the Sublime Topaz and the Shining Topaz! Both ships are off limits to civilians!"
"If I even see you set one foot on one of those ships, I'll slap you in irons and throw you in the dungeons!"
"While you're in the company offices, don't do ANYTHING to make me come after you!"
"Miles Mussillius, Archer of the Imperial Navy! And you really shouldn't be on this vessel."
Are you still here? I highly suggest that you leave the ship before you get into trouble.
"It gives you a great feeling, knowing you're working to make a difference in this world, but the best part is when you get to wind down after the job is done."
"Scelle Lioria, Blunt Expert of the Imperial Navy! What brings you on this vessel?"
"You're not thinking of signing up to the Imperial Legion, are you? We need strong members like you to help in the fight to maintain peace."
"Ahh, nothing like a relaxing break from duty... sometimes I forget what the sky even looks like, stuck inside the hull of that ship."
"Hasell, Blade Expert of the Imperial Navy! And just what are you doing on our ship?"
I thought I told you to leave the ship... don't make me ask you again.
"That Rithle at the Mermaid Inn is one fine woman. I should go and pay her a visit sometime soon, maybe bring her some flowers to brighten up her tavern."
"Vaden Favala, Hand To Hand Combatist of the Imperial Navy! And what the devil are you doing on our ship?"
"By my authority as soldier of the Imperial Legion, I order you to leave this vessel at once!"
Beat it! I'm off duty and I don't have the time to deal with your kind.
"Hickim, Hand To Hand Combatist of the Imperial Navy! And what, may I ask, is your reason for visiting this vessel?"
"Sorry, but this vessel is strictly off limits, I'm going to have to ask you to leave."
"I think I might go into town later, buy myself a few drinks, and just relax before my next shift begins."
"Kunthjor, Archer of the Imperial Navy! Boy, I sure am sick of having to say that."
Do you really think you should be in here?
"Every now and again, when I'm off duty, I feel like getting drunk and starting a fight... then I remember I'm a part of the Imperial Legion, and I realize my superiors wouldn't think too highly of that."
"Lucretre Popillius, Blunt Expert of the Imperial Navy! This ship is off limits to all civilians! You should leave before one of our superiors arrives."
"Are you going to leave peacefully, or will I have to use violence?"
"Smell that fresh sea air... yes, it's a good time to be alive."
"Falcedon Jucania, Blade Expert of the Imperial Navy! You know, no unauthorized personnel are allowed on this ship."
I've already asked you to leave this ship once... don't make me tell you again.
What are you staring at? Can't I take a walk without being accosted by someone?
"Murber Oranius, Hand To Hand Combatist of the Imperial Navy! What brings you to our vessel this fine day?"
"I'm pretty confident in my ability as a fighter, but there is always room for improvement... what do you think?"
"I was hoping perhaps we'd dock at Bravil instead of Leyawiin. I have a little lady waiting for me up there, and I would have liked to have seen her."
"Ildoni Vicicici, Hand To Hand Combatist of the Imperial Navy! Do you really think you should be down here?"
"To be honest, I'm enjoying this break from battle. I may be fit, but my bones still ache every now and again."
"I may be the oldest out of the bunch on that ship, but I'll be damned if I'll let anyone think that makes me the weakest."
"I'm sorry, but I'm at a loss as to what you are doing in my home? May I ask why you have invaded my privacy?"
"Oh? You again? And here I was in the depths of despair, thinking I would never see you again... to what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?"
"Oh! You again! It is so good to see you, what an unexpected pleasure. We have been very happy since you returned my wife's wedding ring."
"Oh? A visitor? We don't get many these days, not with my husband's attitude... I do apologize if he seems a little rude, he's a nice person, really... how else would I have been married to him for so long?"
Oh hello again! Are you sure I can't get you something? I do hope my husband hasn't beaten you with anything yet.
"Well hello! Larahiid welcomes you to the Blue Fig Bakery! Please, take in the sweet smell of the freshly baked wonders that come from our kitchen! Everything is baked the same day, so they're still warm when you buy them!"
"Ahh, you have returned! You must be craving another one of my wife's masterpieces, no?"
"Don't get the wrong idea! Larahiid may work the counter, but it is Frehja that does all the work!"
"Farus! Get those buns out of the oven before they burn, like the last batch! What now? Can't you see I'm busy?"
"Oh, sorry, I can't talk now! Frehja runs a tight kitchen, and everytime I stuff up, she yells at me."
Count Marius Caro receives visitors from eight in the morning to six in the evening every day. Please observe the rules of etiquette in the castle.
Archmage! Your visit is an honor to us. Count Marius Caro will be happy to welcome you from 8 in the morning to 6 in the evening any day.
The Hero of Kvatch! Count Marius Caro will be very curious to hear your story. He will receive you any day from eight in the morning to six in the evening!
"Count Marius Caro would be delighted to see the Protector of Cyrodiil in his castle! From eight in the morning to six in the evening, the count will gladly receive you!"
The Trans-Niben company welcomes you. How can I help?
Greetings sir knight.
"Pleased to meet you! My name is Armod Surrion, formerly from Mournhold, but I moved to Cheydinhal about ten years ago."
"Don't go fiddling with any of the locks around here! I've worked too hard to get those Orc gang members behind bars, and I don't want some snotty-nosed little brat letting them get away!"
"Keeping your nose clean, I hope."
What the hell do you want? I don't have time to deal with tiny pukes like you.
And just what did you do to get into a place like this? You look too much like a goody-two-shoes to be in here.
Just leave.
"Please, you must help Dro'Baad! This one had nothing to do with those Orcs! Dro'Baad was just going to the store to buy some food! Please, Dro'Baad is a good person, you have to help him!"
No!
"Oh, you're here! I... oh, wait, you're not who I'm expecting."
"Hmmm... maybe I should change my top, perhaps? Wait, you again? What do you want now?"
"Oh, oh what should I do? Should I go? It's such a kind offer, but I'm not sure I want to... I mean, I want to, but it's been so long since someone has offered."
"Oh, what should I wear? Maybe the blue dress? Oh, but the green is so much nicer!"
"Ah, another keen adventurer! You have that twinkle in your eye that tells me you've seen many battles! Ahh, that makes me quite nostalgic..."
The adventurer returns! What tales of glory have you to share?
Bah! Can't you leave a man to his misery?
What do you want now? Can't you see I'm thinking of ways of getting rid of that insufferable woman?
That filthy s'wit! He thinks staying outside the house will save him! I'll make that bastard pay for the stupid pranks he puts me through.
"If you find my cowardly husband wandering around the city, try and make a tree fall on him or something."
"Excuse me, but you have to leave now. I need to lock up."
"Excuse me, but you have to leave now. I need to lock up."
Welcome to the Bank of Cyrodiil! Cornelius Cisterzio at your service! Are you here to open an account at our fine institution?
Welcome to the Bank of Cyrodiil! How may Dro'Hajat help you?
The Bank of Cyrodiil is at your service. How can I help?
"Yes, what is it?"
Get out of my room!
Get out of my room!
"Hello there, isn't it a pleasant day?"
Watchoo want?
Spare a bag of gold?
Hello there!
Fresh fish! Get your fish fresh-gutted today!
"If you're looking to buy some fish, you'll have to see me when I'm working in my shop."
"Welcome to my shop, if you want herbs, you're in the right place. You wouldn't happen to have any rotten apples, would you?"
"Oh, hello there! Please, don't mind the smell, it's not poisonous much..."
Few make it out here. What can I do for you?
"Oh great, another one; you better not be a freeloader like Old Man Finn over there."
"Welcome to Vark's Tavern. My name's Vark, which makes this my tavern, so no funny business if you want to be served!"
"Hello, little one!"
Oh. Hello.
How's the shack?
Leave me be.
You're asking for trouble.
"New to the slums, eh? I cook for everyone."
"Everyone who eats food, at any rate."
"I'll give you the who's who, if you're interested."
You're new.
Hi.
"Oh no Mister Shadowscale, don't kill the little lady! SLASH! Eheheheheh..."
Hello.
"Are you a fellow woodsman? I love the outdoors! Oh let me introduce myself, I am Greysmark."
"Don't worry, Juniper and Ob don't bite, they're just very excitable..."
Good hunting to you friend! May your arrow always strike true!
What are you doing here? The bakery isn't open until morning! Come back then...
Welcome! I see the sweet aroma coming from my bakery has piqued your interest! Would you care to sample one of my spiced buns?
"Please, you just have to try a Grill Pie! They're made with only the freshest ground beef and flaky pastry I rolled just this morning! Or maybe some Black Bread? They make for a fantastic roll at lunchtime..."
Well hello there! What's a handsome fellow like yourself doing in a place like this?
Well hello there! What's a pretty girl like yourself doing in a place like this?
"Well hello again, care to buy me a drink?"
"Beat it kid, you're killing my buzz..."
"Oh hey, I almost didn't recognize you in the dark..."
"Hey, you're still walking around, huh? Glad to see you're not in jail yet, not for a lack of trying of course, eh?"
"Yes, yes, you want your shoes repaired, I know! But you're just going to have to wait like everybody else!"
"Wait your turn, please! Oh, it's you again."
"Ahh yes, you come for Ashirani's clothes, you have a good eye for quality! Please, let Ashirani take your measurements!"
Now you want Ashirani to measure you?
"Oh! Ho ho, hello! Please, come in! Oh, er, don't mind the mess... I've been meaning to clean this place up for a while now..."
Have you looked through that pile over there?
Poor Marlvurn...
"Yep, I looked, he's dead... what a shame... I'll never get that money back now..."
What? How did you get in here? I'll have to ask you to leave...
What? How did you get in here? I'll have to ask you to leave...
"Are you here to relax, or hiding from the guards?"
Huh? Who are you? What are you doing in here?
Huh? Who are you? What are you doing in here?
"Hello again, stolen anything good lately?"
What are you doing in here?! Get out!
"Huh? A customer? Well, I'll be damned! I'd almost given up hope!"
"Hey, I got a hot tip that a new gold mine was discovered just to the east of here! Better buy up before all my stock is gone!"
"You have come to Naqvi, that means you wish to know more about the fine art of alchemy..."
"Naqvi is sure, this time, she is on the brink of a great discovery! Well... maybe..."
I bet I know why you're here...
My business has gone down a bit lately... this better not be your doing...
"Please excuse my husband, sometimes he has a bit of a temper... he's a good person, really..."
Yes? You have come to buy Rahjiid's wares? Why not buy some soap? You smell like you could use it.
"You have returned! That is a good sign! It means you enjoy Rahjiid's wares! Come, look, buy, all is good here!"
"I do hope little Reha isn't bothering you, she gets excited when new people are around..."
"What... what are you doing - <cough-hack> - ugh... what are you doing in here? Kid, if you know what's good for you, you'll leave, and never come back..."
"What, you got a death wish kid? What are you doing back here again?"
Wow... there are... three of you... how do you do that?
"Ohhh... oh, look... look at all the colours... ooooooh..."
Can you help me?! You got to help me?! You can't help me! Of course you can't! No one can!
"What's that? No, no! Fire, fire is bad! Yes, it cleans, but it destroys! The fire, the fire, it's in my head! It's burning my thoughts!"
"My word, a healthy soul has entered our midst! You're a very brave one to venture into these parts..."
"Oh, you've returned? If you'd like to help, there are a few chamberpots you could clean out..."
"By the Gods I'm bored... all I do is watch a bunch of boxes all day... what are they going to do, walk away?"
"Ah, some entertainment. Hello."
"Ahh, so you've finally arrived..."
"I see you are still forging the path of your own destiny, designing your own fate... what can this old woman do for you to assist in your travels?"
"Mmmm, you smell that? Isn't it wonderful? It's one of my mother's recipes from Morrowind... shame it still has a while to cook before it's ready to eat..."
Doesn't the aroma of cooking food make you hungry?
"Oh, a customer? I'm amazed you even found my little shop, all the way up here..."
Hello again! You're turning out to be my most regular customer...
"Oh my, you're looking rather thin! Tell you what, you find a seat, and I'll cook you up something nice, hot and filling..."
"You simply must eat more food, you're still too thin."
"I apologize in advance for my wife's cooking... she was so excited to open her own public kitchen, I didn't have the heart to tell her she's a terrible cook."
"You didn't tell Awei what I said before, did you?"
"Oh Samuel... why did you have to do that... stupid, stupid boy..."
Oh Samuel...
Oh Samuel...
"Oh, oh hey, hey, look, you're a good guy, right? You look like a good guy!"
"Okay, look, see, I want, no, no no, that's not right, I need, yes, I need, perhaps, five septims? Yes, yes, that would be enough, more than enough!"
"Please, seriously, five septims, please? You got to give them to me, I really, really need them!"
Come on! What's one septim to you! Nothing! It means the world to me!
Come on! What's one septim to you! Nothing! It means the world to me!

The young sheep has returned to the slaughter...
Get out of my way! Can't you see I'm busy?
So much work to do... I need a vacation.
"Hey, move it! Some of us have jobs to do, you know..."
"If I see you smiling about my name, I'll knock you from one end of the bay to the other..."
"Hey, you couldn't spare a coin or two, could you?"
Looks like rain tonight... I guess I'm going to sleep wet again...
"Move it mate! Our ship's got a deadline to meet, and you're gettin' in the way of our progress! Why don't you go an' bother one of the deckhands on one o' the other ships!"
"Look, can't you go bother someone else?"
"Ahh, nothing quite as good as a refreshing swim in the bay to start your day."
Last one in the bay is a stale sweetroll!
"I guess you've already seen that magnificent ship moored out in the port? She's mine alright, The Heron's Tail! Best ship a captain could ever wish for..."
"Still keeping your feet on dry ground, I see!"
"Hey, I haven't seen you around here before! Are you new to the crew? Oh well, doesn't bother me... you hungry? Sit down, I'll cook something up..."
"Heh, you've come back for that mouth-watering bowl of offal stew, I see..."
"Damn Pinot, thinks he can get away from me, I'll get that money one way or another..."
"So, you got my money yet?"
"Hey, there you are! Thanks again for helping me out with Pinot! Hey, you're not interested in a small game of cards, are you?"
"Leave me alone, won't you?"
Hmmm? What do you want?
Oh what do you want?! Stop bothering me!
"Hey, who are you? You're not one of the crew! If you're looking for a free meal, forget it! I get paid to feed working men, not freeloaders..."
"This isn't a tavern, get your meals elsewhere."
"I'm the muscle on this ship, so don't start anything, or you'll have me to answer to..."
"Keeping your nose clean, I hope..."
"I haven't seen you around these parts before... then again, I'm usually sailing around the western seas these days, so you'll have to forgive me if I'm not up to date."
"Heh heh, another big win last night on the dice! This town is full of sheep just ready to be sheared..."
Have you seen my useless excuse for a son around anywhere?
"At this rate, I'm never going to retire."
"Ugh, I have had just about enough of my father's constant barrage of criticism."
One of these days my father is going to have something nice to say about me. But I doubt it will be anytime soon.
"Huh? What are you doing down here? You shouldn't be here, you'll scare the horses."
Please don't scare the horses.
"I tell you, the things I put up with for that pig of a husband!"
You talk to me more than my husband does.
Oh? Who do we have here? Come to hear the tales of the great sea-mistress Red Sting?
Can you make this quick? I'm preparing to go on a trip to Valenwood to recover an ancient Bosmer idol that a client of mine is itching to have.
"Ahh, a man who is not afraid to flaunt his wealth, one who does not see gemstones as simply a plaything of a fine woman! Azzhad has a very fine selection of male jewelry, so please, take your time and look over his wares."
"Ahh, Azzhad works with pretty gems every day, but today, he sees the prettiest gem of all walking into his store! Please, tell him how he can assist you."
"What? What are you doin' in here? Why can't people jest leave me alone! I don't bother anyone, why does everyone have'ta bother me?"
You again? I thought I told you to leave me alone!
"You look like the kind of person who enjoys a good, hardy mead! I know you'll love my personal brew, the recipe comes straight from the snowy plains of my homeland of Skyrim! Up there, a good mead is worth its own weight in gold."
"Come back for more of my mead, eh? Heh, I knew you would, they always do."
"Beat it kid, I'm working here."
"Beat it kid, you're drawing attention to me."
"You got something to say to me, shrimp?"
"Oh, here comes Mister All-High-And-Mighty! Tell me, to what do I owe this grand pleasure?"
"Oh, here comes Miss All-High-And-Mighty! Tell me, to what do I owe this grand pleasure?"
What do you want?
I thought I told you to stop bothering me!
"Oh, hello! Welcome to the Bayside Inn! Can I offer you a drink? Or perhaps some of our fresh bread, baked just this morning?"
"Welcome to the Bayside Inn! We have warm beds to rent, plenty of good food and drink, oh, and try my wife's bread, she bakes it herself!"
"Don't mind Pansy, she's just very affectionate... if she becomes a bother, I'll put her outside for a little while."
"Oh, hello again dear, I'm just sitting down to have some tea... would you care for a cup? Or perhaps some fresh fruitcake?"
"Beat it hatchling, I'm too busy to deal with weaklings like yourself."
"So, have you found my targ... my brother's location?"
"You have served your purpose, now leave me be."
Stop bothering me.
"Oh great, another freeloader... look kid, we're full up as it is, and I don't need another mouth that doesn't know where its wallet is."
"So, you convinced them to pay up yet, or what?"
"Hey look, it's the one person I can count on to get the rent paid, and you don't even live here! What can I do for you friend?"
"Oh, so you're in here to shop? I thought maybe you got lost or somethin'."
"So, did Wolfe get her order on time?"
What? Have you come here to buy one of my paintings?!
"So, did you hand those sketches out to people? Did they like them?"
"Oh, I can never thank you enough! Orders have been pouring in since you helped me! I actually ate fresh bread this morning!"
"Welcome, welcome. Do you see anything you like?"
You were in Oblivion? How exciting! What are the Daedra like?
"Would you like to see me dance for you? I'll dance you something, tell you something, play you something and sing you to sleep."
"Surely you want to see full trembling breasts and bare long legs all the way down?! One hundred gold pieces, no installments!"
"Come in, I have everything here or can get anything! Girls, Alcohol, Skooma, Moon Sugar. A horse as well, and I don't ask what for!"
You've been to Oblivion? Is it really as hot as it is here?
"Traveling for long? Don't you want to rest a little on velvety skin and warm cheeks, and lips as soft as silk?"
"No, back off with your questions! Depart! Leave me!"
I have them. Yes! Yes. Yes! I took them. I ripped them out of the mirror when the sunlight shone.
"Mhm. Mhm. I have one, and Ln has one! We each have one in our laps!"
"Heroes from all over Cyrodiil I may welcome here, sire, but no one is as welcome as you are."
"Sire, yes. How may I serve you?"
Are you looking for a deal or have you come to warm my ears with sire's wide-travelled wisdom?
"A pleasure sire, as always."
"You have such wonderful, long and strong hair. Shall we say one gold for each centimeter?"
"Sweetheart, see how gracefully you have been shaped. If you ever want to get rid of one of them, I could make you a good price for it."
"On first sight, I thought you were so ugly, there'd be nothing useful to cut off. But now I have seen your eyes."
"Ooh, what lovely, soft skin you have. Just what I'm looking for as a flavor enhancer for a scamp poison!"
"What wonderful, healthy teeth!"
What a man! What muscles! You must lead an extremely healthy life and possess a noble heart!
"You look very dried, dear. If you wish a drink I have something very special, home-made to offer you."
"Jafiir, artist, trader and an admirer of the fine arts. At your service."
If you would please stop waving your tongue around in front of my face so unpleasantly!
"Ah, you want to barter! You have gold? Because I only take gold! If you have no gold, you cannot barter! You understand?"
"My name is Marwen, I'm just this town's humble executioner."
A clean person like you must be new in town!
You are the hero of Kvatch? I thought you'd be taller!
You are the hero of Kvatch? Well then you've led a really interesting life!
So you are the famous hero of Kvatch. And now you're here to clean up Bravil? Well. Let's see if you're up to a real challenge.
You are the hero of Kvatch? Well then I'm glad that I can sleep safely in my bed again!
"You're not from Bravil, and you won't stay in Bravil!"
"I'm Riia, and as you can see from these ears, their length make me chief here. And you may now walk out of my way, peasant. Move, move, move."
It's so great that you are here. You can't understand how it is all alone in this town with only humans and beasts!
Abandoned. Surrounded by primitive natives. Thank you. Thank you so much!
"You don't happen to have some coins for a sister in blood, brother?"
"Listen sister, there is only space for one dark, bad, wood elf in town. And it's definitely not you!"
I'm all ears. And woe to you who laughs!
"Ah... you're that hero from Kvatch? Well, I thought you were... taller?"
What do you want to know?
I bought this weird book and I see no connection between this book and any riddles!
"You know, one would expect that there would be a trader to sell you torches in a decent cave system!"
I can carry any amount of cave loot around with me! Every little bone and anything else! But not that pretty whistling skull!
You are the hero of Kvatch? I thought that would have been me.
"Of course I go on adventures! All my friends are doing the same thing all day, every day! It's enough to drive you crazy!"
"You can never go out for a drink together or to a nice concert, besides there are no bards here!"
"Finally after such a long, long time I had the opportunity to sleep with a young woman, and I can't remember anything!"
"So, so. So you're an adventurer, huh? You think women are into that?! If you go to Melissa, I'll kill you!"
"Yes, dare to challenge me, you stinky maggot! I am an officer and representative of the law in Bravil."
"If you don't want to buy me a drink, get lost!"
"Listen carefully, friend. Melyssa is my girl! I decide who speaks to her, and you're definitely not one of them!"
My name is Tessalie. Jainy Tessalie. And I know who you are.
Interesting. Where were you measured for this? Looks almost like we have the same tailor?

Sire?
A wonderful good day.
Aye?
Mistress?
Sire?
Your most obedient servant.
"Your herald, sire."
Sire?
Leave me be.
"Sorry, I'm a little busy at the moment, so could you make this quick?"
"Hey there, enjoying the bread?"
Well hello there! What brings you to the Twin Goblet Alehouse?
"I suggest trying the crumbed lamb, it's delicious."
"Welcome to Olive's Bakery! I'm Olive, in case you were wondering."
"Back for another baked treat, hmmm? I knew you would."
"Hey there, welcome to the Twin Goblet Alehouse, what can I get you today?"
"So, are you going to order something, or are you just going to keep asking questions?"
By the Gods! What is a man doing in here?! Get out! Get out get out get out!
"This is a bath house, why are you still wearing clothing? Don't worry, we're all women, there's nothing to be afraid of."
"Well hello there, I haven't seen you here before, are you new in town?"
EEEEEEK! What are you doing in here?! Men aren't allowed in the women's bathing house! Get out before I call the guards!
"Isn't it a bit stuffy in all those clothes? It's a bath house, get comfortable, don't be shy."
Isn't the steam from the hot water just wonderful?
"Oh, a strapping young man in the women's bath house! How exciting! So, like what you see, hmmm?"
"Girl, don't be scared, we're all friends here! Get those clothes off and come join us in the warm water."
"Ah, about time a girl with a bit of meat on her bones came here!"
"A woman? What is a woman doing in the men's bathing house? I'm surprised, but I can't say I'm not somewhat pleased."
"What in the world are you doing? This is a bath house, why are you wearing all that clothing?"
"Nothing quite as relaxing as a day at the bath house, aye?"
"Erm, I think perhaps you've walked into the wrong bath house lady, this is the men's bathing house."
Isn't it a bit hot in here to be wearing all that? Take it off and relax.
"I've got to get clean, got a big date tonight with a cute Breton girl."
"Whoa, what the hell is a woman doing in here?!"
Why in the world are you wearing all those clothes in a bath house? Aren't you boiling in all that?
I should probably start getting ready to go to work... hmmm... maybe a few minutes more...
"I've not seen you here before. I'm Sylori Amatius, and I like the gruel in this tavern, so don't say anything bad about it!"
"You're back again, I see."
Hello?
"Ahh, a fellow Ranger! Come to see the beauty that is the Arboretum?"
"I don't mind a brief distraction, but I really must be getting back to work soon."
"Taking care of the Arboretum is hard work, but someone has to do it."
Greetings! You must be that new member I keep hearing about! How's life in the Ranger's Guild treating you?
"Have you seen Scruff? His dinner time is coming up, and I have a big juicy bone for him to chew on."
"Hello there, you must be our newest member! I'm Jordi, and it's a pleasure to meet you."
"Hello again! Doing your part for nature, I hope."
"Ahh, a new member! It is a great pleasure to meet you."

"A new member? Ohh, Tsava loves new members, always exciting, so many new stories to hear and tell."
"Happy hunting, friend."
Another new member to our guild? How wonderful!
"Until you accept and embrace nature, you will never truly be at peace, don't you agree?"
"So, how are you fitting into your new life as a member of the Rangers Guild?"
"Ooh, you're new, I can tell! I haven't smelt someone like you before! Oh, ho, don't worry! You don't smell bad, honest!"
"Ahh, I remember that smell, it's you again! How are you?"
"Oh, hello! I haven't heard your voice before, you must be new around here! How goes it?"
"Oh hey, it's you again! I thought I recognized your footsteps."
"Ahh, our newest member! How is life treating you as a member of our little family?"
Rahaq says hello.

"Here comes the hero of Skingrad! My my, aren't we blessed by your presence, hero? Maybe you forgot who could get hurt with that little stunt of yours though?"
"I can't talk now, can't you see I'm busy?"
"What are you doing?! I'm trying to sleep, get out, right now!"
[Unintelligible sounds]
"Call me Waxwing, Archer Extraordinaire! Or just call me Waxwing, as that's my name!"
I'm always willing to talk!
"Good day to you, can I help with something?"
"Come closer dear, I don't bite."
"Well hello there! It seems a little fly has wandered into our web! Fellow members, let us make this tiny morsel welcome in our home..."
"Ohh, you're back! And here I was thinking we were going to be bored today."
"Welcome brother to our Sanctuary! So you come from the Sanctuary in Cheydinhal, I hear it's a bit more lavish than our little cavern here in Skingrad."
"Welcome sister to our Sanctuary! So you come from the Sanctuary in Cheydinhal, I hear it's a bit more lavish than our little cavern here in Skingrad."
"Oh my, it's you! You're the Listener! To what do we owe this grand honor?!"
"Well well well, what do we have here? A stranger has wandered into our midst, how... fortunate for us."
"Warm greetings to you brother, please, make yourself at home."
"Warm greetings to you sister, please, make yourself at home."
"As I live and breathe, the Listener! It is a deep honor to have finally met you!"
Do you know why they call me Copperhead?
"Come a little closer so I can pop you, you little bloodsack you."
"Mmmm, hello brother, so nice to see you! Killed anyone pretty lately?"
"Mmmm, hello sister, so nice to see you! Killed anyone pretty lately?"
"Oh! Oh! The Listener! Oh my, what an honor! Oh, is my hair alright?!"
"Ohhh, a new face! How wonderful! I feel like... singing!"
"Back for more?! I've been thinking of a second verse, but I need inspiration...you'll do fine."
Ohh hello brotherrrr! How are you this fiiiine day?
Ohh hello sisterrrr! How are you this fiiiine day?
"Gasp! The Listener! Oh, oh, please stay! Please! I have a lovely song about disembowelment I want you to hear!"
"Go on, steal something, I dare yah! I feel like beating the snot out of someone today, so just go and give me a reason to."
I've got my eye on you.
"Greetings, and welcome to Two Moons! I supply only the finest gemstones, and a large range of gold and other necklaces and amulets."
I'm glad to see Orgro hasn't reduced you to a bloody pulp yet.
"Oh hey there, how's it going? Can I help you with anything?"
Yes? What was it you wanted?
Oh my! A beggar has broken into our home! Somebody call the town guard! He's after my jewelry!
Oh my! A beggar has broken into our home! Somebody call the town guard! She's after my jewelry!
"Ewww, and he smells too!"
"Ewww, and she smells too!"
"I'm sorry, but have we met before? Because I don't remember your face, and I most definitely don't remember inviting you into my home! Please leave immediately."
You again? I thought I told you to leave!
"Well, hello there! Welcome to Magh-Gra's Tack and Supplies! Whether it's a saddle or riding clothes you need, or maybe a few recipes on how best to prepare horses, I'll be sure to be able to meet your needs!"
"BURP! Oh, ho ho, sorry, that palomino I had for lunch isn't agreeing with me."
"Hello, aren't you a cute little thing? How can I help you today?"
You ever get time to ride horses?
"Oh, hello there... sorry, I'm a little new to this."
"Oh, erm... erm... how was... your day? No, that's not good enough..."
"Well, aren't you a strapping young lad? I could have a lot of fun with you, and I'm sure you'd have a lot of fun with me, what do you say?"
"Well, aren't you a pretty one? Don't worry, just because you're a girl doesn't mean we can't have a bit of fun."
"Back for more, hmmm?"
Well hello there! Care to buy me a drink?
"Oh, you came back? I knew you would."
"If my wife knew I was here, she'd kill me."
Maybe my wife won't be so mad when she sees how much I've won.
What is it? What do you want? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something here?
How the hell does one man get three aces?!
"Mmmm, come on! Papa needs a new fur comb!"
...looks like my fur will be tangled for a little while longer...
What are you looking at me like that for? Can't a woman gamble with her own money?
"Beat it kid, you're ruining my winning streak!"
"Heh, this is like taking candy from babies, only instead of candy, it's money, and instead of babies, it's idiots."
Care to join the game? I can give you good odds.
"Hey, you there! My eyesight isn't what it used to be, so tell me, is this a six of hearts, or an eight of diamonds?"
...I think I've been betting with coat buttons this whole time...
"Hey, don't look at me like that, I have nothin' to do with the other people here! I don't know what goes on in this place, and I don't care! I just came here to drink."
"I've drunk in this tavern for fifteen years, I ain't stoppin' now."
Can't a man wallow in the dark in peace anymore? Go and annoy someone else.
You again? What do you want this time?
"What's wrong? Never seen a woman this ugly before?! Go on, beat it before I make your face look like mine!"
"What, are you attracted to wrinkles or something? Get lost!"
"Alright, alright, there's no need to get so close! Get any closer and you'll give away my hand, so go on, back off!"
I thought I told you to back off?!
"Oh, hello there! I heard you had a hand in dealing with that little business involving that ogre pretending to be my brother! I must thank you for resolving it... the only question now is, where in the world is my brother?"
Perhaps Baldor's still on that trip in High Rock?
"Hee hee hee, wow, this stuff is really great."
"Am I... am I floating? I feel like I'm floating, oooh..."
What's a person like you doing in a place like this?
I thought I told you to beat it? Don't make me tell you again.
"Oh aye, I know you, I've heard about you! Word travels fast in these places."
"Keeping the chaos flowing, aye?"
I thought I told you to beat it? Don't make me tell you again.
Ever thought of becoming a Ranger? It is a worthy way to live.

I'm really busy.

"If you ever do business with my husband, always remember to read the fine print."

"The Imperial City is a magnificent place, and the first time I arrived, I was astounded! But since then, the novelty has sort of worn off, and now it just seems like there's nothing to do."
Maybe I should organise a little horse ride through the country with my friend Nar-kagra in Skingrad?
"Welcome, welcome! You've come to the Empire's Best Tailoring, and that's not just a name! Our outfits are all lovingly made with only the finest hands and years of experience!"
"If I hear you've gone to see Palonirya, I'll ban you from my store."
"I don't believe we've met before, my name is Alvyn! Say, you wouldn't happen to know where I can get some Mora Tapinella fungus, would you?"
Perhaps I'll just have to search the garden at the University a little harder next time.
"Ohh, hello! My name is Amillia, and I'm a little new around here! Could you tell me where the Arena is?"
"My trip to Cyrodiil has been expensive, but it's been worth every last coin."
"Who are you, and why are you bothering me? Bah, I don't have time to waste on a filthy peasant such as yourself!"
"Oh great, you again! What do you want this time?"
"Bah, those fools were idiots to think they could take on the Imperial City."
"Bah, I'm sick of being stuck on dry land!"
"Hello there! The name's Dulaus Vantain, seasoned vampire hunter!"
"Stay safe friend, the creatures of the night lurk around every corner, but even after forty years Seridur still says I'm the best. You know it's funny, he hasn't aged a day since I joined the Order."
"Don't think you can deceive me, creature of the night! I know who you are, and I know what you've done, I can see it in your eyes! On this day, I will make sure you never hurt another being ever again!"
"Well hey there! I haven't met you before! Say, you wouldn't know where I could get a job around here, do you?"
"Still no job, but my hopes remain high."
"Now, whatever in the world could a decrepit old man do for someone as young as yourself?"
"Come back to check up on me, have you? Heh, don't worry, I'm still kicking! Sometimes I'm even amazed myself."
"Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you! The name's Jacob, I'm sure you've heard of me by now."
"Changed your mind, have you? Wealth truly is irresistible, isn't it?"
"Oh ho! What a match! Hey, did you see the fight between Varen and Astral at the Arena the other day?! It was colossal!"
Is there no greater joy than watching two people beat the living crap out of one another?
"Go on! Rip his bloody throat out you useless pansy! Huh, what? Can't you see I'm watching this? What do you want?"
"Blast it! I can't stand being out of work like this! If I spend another day without patrol, I'll go mad!"
"I bet all sorts of interesting things are happening in the city, like thieves and bandit raids..."
Don't disturb me! Can't you see I'm busy thinking?!
Shhh! I'm hunting pixies!
"Wait! Was that one?! Oh, no, it's just my shoe..."
Hello! What can I do for you today?
"The cuter animals are the most satisfying to kill, especially the real fluffy ones."
"Why, hello! It's a pleasure to meet you! What can I do for you today?"
"Hello again dear, what was it you wanted this time?"
Why have you come to me? Do you wish to know more of the Divines? Or perhaps you seek a blessing?
May the Divines bless you this day.
"Greetings! The name is Nathanial, the Bard! I play every day from midday to midnight at Pub 102 in the Talos Plaza District! Come along if you're a fan of good music and fun times."
"Remember, I play from midday to midnight, at Pub 102!"
Have a request for a song?
"I am K'Mar, but K'Mar does not know who you are! On her many walks at night, she has not once seen you before!"
"May the moon always disappear at just the right moment for you, friend."
"Hello! I am Knight Commander Percy, divine knight of her lady, Kynareth! What can I do for you on this fine day?"
A fine day to you child.
"Good day to you! I'm Clair Velander, and I'm a traveling priest who has come on a pilgrimage to the Imperial City to see the Temple of the One."
"The Imperial City truly is breathtaking, don't you think?"
"Greetings! My name is Alanus Medici, and I'm a priest on a pilgrimage to the Temple of the One in the Imperial City! Have you seen it yet? It truly is remarkable."
"Ahh, welcome! Welcome! Are you here for business? Or perhaps... BUSINESS? Hmmm."
"Ahh, it's you again! What can I do for you today, hmmm?"
"(The priest seems deep in thought, and does not respond to your greeting)"
"I don't really have time to talk, and if you're not in the Mages Guild, then we don't have any business to talk about anyway."
"If you want to make money in this world, you need to seize every opportunity you get."
"Oh, ah, Archmage! Erm, how are you this fine day? Who, me? Oh, no, I'm fine, I'm just... studying! Yes, studying! I'll be off then, to... study..."
"Hello again Archmage! Erm, still studying! Can I help you with anything?"
"Archmage! Erm, erm, it's not what it looks like, honest! I'm down here because... because... because I'm studying the... erm... strange fungal formations in the, erm, tunnels! Beneath the city! Yes! Well, erm, I'll get right back to it!"
"Hello again Archmage! My, erm, my studies are coming along nicely!"
"This must be your lucky day! I bet you do a bit of alchemy, am I right? Well, I've got an amazing range of rare and expensive ingredients you won't find anywhere else!"
"Oh, it's Nosy! Are you actually going to spend some coin this time, or just ask more questions?"
"Hey, looking for anything in particular? If you're interested, we stock a few 'beverages' that you can't find in any other normal, law-abiding tavern."
"Welcome, welcome! Come in and have a drink! Unless you're a pesky guard, then you can just beat it!"
"The bar's closed for a few hours so I can get some sleep! Come back later, and don't bother me again until we open."
"I get paid to keep this place nice and tidy, right? You start any trouble, or you start snooping where you don't belong, and you'll be answering to me and my sharp metal friend here, understand?"
I've got my eye on you...
"Welcome, friend, to the Emporium of Waterfront Traders! We're an honest band of honest merchants, trying to earn an honest living, selling only the finest goods at honest prices! Did I happen to mention we're honest?"
"Heh, don't worry, we're still honest merchants! Honest!"
"And just what the hell do you think you're doing down here then? Come on, answer me!"
"Oh, hey, look! It's the snoop again! What do you want this time?"
"Psst! Hey, over here! Yeah, heh heh! I bet I've got just what you need! You won't find produce like this up in the city, not at these prices!"
"Heh, back for more, huh? Heh, I knew you would."
"Woah woah, heh, you've caught me on my time off! I deserve it, don't I? If you want to trade, meet me when I'm in the Waterfront Tunnel, okay?"
"You're an eager one, aren't you?"
You look like a strong one! How would you like to join the Aviogetto Gang?
No one can defeat the Aviogetto Gang!
Who are you? You're not one of my gang! How did you get in here?!
What part of beat it didn't you understand?
"Hey, you! Boss says not to let anyone get in his hideout! So, don't go in there, you got that?"
"Damn Rhincodons! If it weren't for them, I'd be drinking in a warm tavern by now."
"Hey, you couldn't sneak me some mead, could you? I'll even settle for ale, if you have it."
The boss sure is tough on us! I'm sick of standing around in this mouldy cave all day long! When are we going to see some action?!
"Not now, I'm busy."
You better not be an Aviogetto spy! I won't tolerate one of his boys walking around on my turf!
"That damn Caspus Aviogetto thinks he's the best around here! Well, I'll show him."
We've been stuck down here for days! I feel like such an idiot.
Maybe the boss isn't coming.
"I could have beaten those stupid Aviogetto Gang goons with both hands tied behind my back! But... erm... my leg started hurting, and... I have a stomach ache."
Those Aviogetto Gang goons got lucky today.
"Are you with the Rhincodon Gang, or are you with the Aviogetto Gang?"
You'd better not be an Aviogetto pretending to be one of us! The boss would kill me if I served one of them.
"Don't even think of starting anything with me! My father is the leader of the Rhincodon Gang, don't you know!"
"One day I'll take over father's position, and I will be the leader of the Rhincodons!"
This is certainly a welcome change! You don't see too many customers this far down in the Waterfront Tunnel.
Hello again! You're turning out to be my most frequent customer.
"You look like the pleasant sort, what can I do for you today?"
"Good day to you, friend! Hey, do me a favor and drop by my partner's shop, would you? She gets such a kick when someone comes and looks around."
"I don't mind having my partner bring home the money, although sometimes I do feel a little guilty."
"Hey, I haven't met you before! Oh ho ho, you haven't heard, have you? I have the best story! Do you want to hear it?"
"If you thought my last story was good, wait until you hear about the time I had a drinking contest with Talos himself!"
"So there was this one time right, I'm in the bar, and there she is across the room... Lifts-Her-Tail, herself... or maybe it was just someone dressed as a maid. Whoever they were, they didn't appreciate me asking for a price."
"It's like Grandscale used to say, if you can't fix it, use it or eat it... then screw it or throw it away!"
"They send me to the Imperial City for business, and they can't even spend enough coin to at least put me in one of the hotels! I'm reduced to staying in some underground communal apartment with all the other low-lives."
I can only imagine how many creatures are living in the bed I'm reduced to sleeping in.
"Chestnuts! I've got fresh, roasted chestnuts for sale! Get them while they're still hot! Mmmm, smell that? They're delicious!"
"I've still got plenty of rich, nutty chestnuts for sale! But they're going fast!"
"The smell of warm chestnuts has led you to me, but I'm afraid I've finished selling them for the day! Come back later, and I'll have a fresh batch of piping hot chestnuts to fill your belly."
"I told you, I haven't got any more chestnuts at the moment! Come back later."
"Hello customer! I have today a special treat, just for you! Is Rat On Stick! Is good, you like!"
"Still plenty of Rat On Stick left! Still warm, still greasy!"
"You come for Rat On Stick? You come back later! Now is time for rest! I will sell Rat On Stick later, if you want it then, then come for it."
"You no listen? I sell Rat On Stick LATER, not now."
"If you're interested, I can recharge your magical items for a small fee! I promise I'll take good care of your equipment."
"If you have any weapons low on charge, I can top them back up for you."
"If you have any business involving the Mages Guild, you're probably best off speaking with Lys Koch himself, seeing as I'm just his tag-along apprentice."
"I love the opportunity of seeing the Imperial City, but I feel like I'm Lys Koch's slave."
"Heh, well hello! Welcome to my little bakery down here in the Tunnels! What can I get for you today?"
"I suggest trying one of the shortbread cookies! They're a day old, but they still taste just as good!"
"I admire your enthusiasm, but I'm afraid I've finished selling my goods for the day! Try again later, I'll be more than happy to serve you."
"If you want my baked goods, you'll have to see me at my stall in the Waterfront Tunnel."
"Blessed! Blessed are you who have come to me for guidance in these dark times! For you, and you alone, have had the courage to accept the love of the Divines into your heart, for that alone shall be your salvation!"
Only through the Divine's teachings can you be saved!
"If you don't mind, I'm quite busy, so could we make this quick?"
Must you persist in bothering me with your petty questions?
"Hello, and welcome to my little cafe down here in the Tunnel! Find a seat, and I'll get you a nice hot cup of my sweet tea!"
"Don't worry about asking for seconds, there is still plenty more tea where that came from."
"Huh? Oh, no, it's nothing like that! Damian and I are just friends, really!"
"Shop's closed, runt! Beat it before I wail on you something serious."
Shove off! Beat it before I wail on you something serious.
I thought I told you to beat it? Or would you prefer it if I beat you instead?
"I am Benadict Melius, customs officer of the Imperial Legion, currently stationed here in the Imperial City! What can I do for you today?"
Be sure to declare all equipment for processing before entering or leaving the city.
"Hello citizen! Have you come about the rat problem we are currently facing? It's messy work, but we'll be sure to pay well."
"We still haven't resolved our vermin issue, so the job offer remains open."
How's that task we gave you coming along?
Thanks again for clearing up that little pest issue we were having! I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say thank you.
What do you want?
What do you want now?
"Please kind sir, could N'dreia have a few coins? This one was so hungry this morning, he was forced to lick moss off the walls."
"Please kind lady, could N'dreia trouble you for a coin? This one was so hungry this morning, he was forced to lick moss off the walls."
"Being a beggar for so long, you stop being surprised at what things in this world are edible."
"Well, howdy stranger! You're a strapping young lad, aren't you? Looking for a good time darlin'?"
"Well, aren't you a pretty little thing? Don't worry sweetie, for the right price, I'll swing whichever way you want."
You wouldn't know a good time if it crept up behind you and bit you on the arse!
"Spare a coin for a poor, old woman?"
"Spare a coin for a... oh, you're from the Thieves Guild, aren't you?"
No one ever suspects the smelly old beggar.
"Heeeeey! Hey buddy! Hey, I bet... urp... I bet I got EXAC-ETLY... what 'churr lookin' for!"
"A woman told me to get lossst the other day, but joke's on her! I already AM lost."
CATS! CATS EVERYWHERE! GIANT ONES! TUNNELING UNDERNEATH US! TUNNELING BESIDE US! TUNNELING IN OUR VERY MINDS!
PANTS! PANTS EVERYWHERE!
What?!
What do you want now?! Come to make fun of my beard this time?!
Salutations to you! How can I serve you on this fine day?
Hello again dear! What can I get for you this time?
"Hey there, how'd you like some nice fresh crab? Caught me some real bigguns this mornin'."
"Still got plenty of good crab meat left, but I don't know how long I'll have it for."
Who are you? Another one of those Legionnaire goons come to tax us some more?
What are you still doing hanging around here?
What're you lookin' at pipsqueak?
Know anywhere around here I can get some good mead?
You don't look that worse off; what's someone like you doing down here in the Waterfront slums?
"What, you get a kick out of seeing people worse off than you or something?"
"Don't go messin' with the graves, or the next one I'll be digging will be yours."
"Stay out of the way of my duties, and we'll get along fine."
Huh? Wh-what do you want?
"Hey, it's not like the guy needed the house anymore! Why let it go to waste?"
"Oh, hello there! I do hope you haven't come to get your equipment repaired, because you'll be quite disappointed."
"It's happy, young faces like yours that tell me that everything in the world will turn out alright."
"Greetings! We don't get many patrons like yourself in these parts! So, what can I get you?"
Welcome back friend! What can I get for you this time?
"S'kasha sees many things on her walks around the city, many shiny, pretty things! S'kasha wishes very much that the shiny pretty things were hers, yes she does."
"S'kasha remembers this one, this one knows of S'kasha's love for pretty things! Perhaps this one has brought S'kasha a pretty thing, no?"
"Salutations to you! My name is Sylfa Gouttes-de-Lune, and I am an Altmer Crusader from the Isle of Artaeum, on a mission here in your lovely country."
Hello again! I trust you are keeping well?
"I am sorry, but if you wish to ask questions, I suggest you speak with my superior officer, Sylfa Gouttes-de-Lune."
"As I told you before, if you wish to talk, speak with Sylfa Gouttes-de-Lune."
"You don't have a coin to spare for a poor old elf, do you?"
"A storm is coming, I just hope my roof won't leak tonight."
Excuse me! I'm trying to read...
"Come to talk to me, have you? I am Gindle Morton, and I keep an eye on the southern warehouse on the docks of Anvil Bay."
"You're not one of my regular customers! No matter, gold is gold! So, what can I get you today?"
You better not be a guard or a snitch...
Talking to me again?
"Hail, land lover!"
"Welcome, welcome!"
Wadda ya want?
"Oh, hello there! My, you're a strong looking one! Let me guess, you've traveled a fair bit, haven't you?"
"It has been so lonely since my husband went to sea, not to mention how incredibly boring it is now."
"Ooh, you've come to keep me company, haven't you?"
"Hey, have you heard about that gang of women beating up foolish men and stealing all their things? It sounds so... liberating! I'm thinking of joining them!"
"Well hello there! I haven't seen you in town before! My name is Menelri, and it's a pleasure to meet you!"
"You look like the kind of person who enjoys a fine wine! I bet you're not satisfied with your regular cheap and nasty, over the counter vintage, you prefer something with class!"
"Back for another bottle, hmmm? I knew you had a taste for good wine when I first saw you."
"Well there's a new face, just so you know this isn't a good place to be looking for some new friends."
Back again eh? Don't you be killing my patrons... They're my life blood ya know.
Arrr! What's a land lover like you doin' in these parts! Begone before I run you through with my sword!
You got a deathwish kid? I thought I told you to get lost!
You don't belong here land child! Get going before you hurt yourself.
Are you addicted to pain or something? Get lost before I do something you'll regret.
"Go away, you're bothering me! If I wasn't on my final warning with the town guards, I'd punch you right in the face! Get lost already!"
"You really know how to push your luck, don't you?"
"I hear there's a shipment of salmon coming into the port in a few days... perhaps if I slip the shipping master a few septims, I can get on the unloading crew, maybe have a taste of the goods! Mmmm, yum!"
No meal tastes quite as good as a free one.
"The damn shipping master has got me working double shifts again! The gold is alright, I guess, but I haven't had a good night's sleep in days."
Yawn! Maybe I'll just have a little lie down behind one of these crates.
Hello.
"Not causing any trouble, I hope."
"Hello friend, how are you today?"
"Oh goodness, I wasn't expecting company! Please do excuse the mess. Lucy! Get down from there... don't worry, she doesn't bite."
Have you seen Lucy? She was here just a minute ago...
"Keeping animals is highly rewarding, but the food bill is absolutely atrocious."
"Hello. My name is Rosteir, and I have nothing since a daedroth destroyed my home."
I see you're still doing well for yourself.
"I'm not really in the mood for talking, so whatever it is you have to say, say it."
Come back to gloat at the poor woman?
"Oh hello dear! Please, come in out of the cold and sit by the fire! You stay out there too long and you'll catch a chill! Are you hungry? I have plenty of food to share."
Hello again dear! Are you sure I can't offer you some warm shepherd's pie?
Huh? Wh-what? What are you doing in my house?
You didn't tell the guards did you?
"Ooh, heh heh, be careful yeah? Don't trip over any of my boxes! I have a few..."
"Ooh, the weather ain't lookin' too good... heh heh heh, but I'm prepared for the worst."
"Hey, you're not from town, are you? Can you keep a secret?"
Hey! Today I found a rat under our bed! Isn't that just great?!
Please... don't let... my appearance... scare you... I'm a nice person... honest... just a little bit... slow...
Uh... hello.
"Brrrr! It's freezing! Even with the oven and the fire going, I'm still too cold! Whoever said Nords can put up with the cold are big fat liars!"
"Maybe if I warmed up some beer and drank it, I'd be warmer."
"You're looking a bit more vertical than my usual customers! HA HA HA! Sorry, just a bit of gravedigger humor."
"You're looking a bit pale! Maybe you should order a coffin, just in case."
"Well howdy there, what can I do for you?"
"I've got some great quality mutton if you're interested, cheap too!"
"When we were buying these cruddy clothes, I would have liked to have at least gotten some decent shoes... these stone floors are freezing my toes off!"
"Don't worry about the smell, I use lye when I'm dealing with furs! Just be careful you don't get any in your eyes, it stings like hell."
"Hey, there's my little hunter! Heh heh, how's life treating you my friend?"
"Ah... a visitor? How... how unexpected! Please, please, come in! Don't let my face frighten you, I'm not a monster!"
"Oh, it's you again! What a welcome surprise! Please, what is it that you need?"
"Hello, and welcome to Kraken's Luxury Spa!"
"I am Melinda Kraken, the proprietress."
"We offer use of the pool free of charge, but if you would like something to drink or a massage we can accommodate you for a modest price."
"Hello Mi' lord, can I offer you something to drink? Mead? Tea, perhaps?"
"Hello Mi' lady, can I offer you something to drink? Mead? Tea, perhaps?"
"Greetings, I'm Hald."
"They call me [QUOTE]Hald Warm-hands[QUOTE], Mistress Melinda employs me to provide massages to the patrons of the Spa, for a reasonable fee."
Hello! I'm Olaf! Are you enjoying the Spa? I am!
Hello again!
"Oh, where is he? You there, go and find him!"
"Can I help you, sir?"
"Can I help you, madam?"
"Hello sir, can I help you?"
"Hello miss, can I help you?"
Why are you speaking to me? Go away!
Hello there! Isn't this a glorious day?
"Hello, what are you doing here?"
"Hello, how nice to see you."
You're not supposed to be down here.
I'm a little busy just now.
Sir?
Ma'am?

"No blood, no spell will lead you out of here, mortal. You will have all time to wait and understand."

Sire! Yay!
Beware. The rain has long since washed the shine from the stones in these halls. All of this was once carved in black obsidian...
"You take the right one and I the left one. They lead into a large hall, I'll meet you there. And be careful. Yours is full of traps."
Bloody fool! Do you really think you can stop me? Ossouliam brezza!
Yes?
It wasn't me!
"I hear nothing, I see nothing, and I know nothing. Like a stone. Yes. That's what I am: a stone."
By the gods! You must be Ygor's brother!
"By the gods, I am blind!"
What a beautiful garment! You must be very wealthy.
I'm just standing here and amusing myself.
You know who I am and what I'm doing here. So let's move on from that!
"Oh, Marwen?! Anything that doesn't have to do with graveyards and chopping off heads?"
"Oh, Marwen?! All heads off and the cemetery is blooming?!"
"Oh Mr. Watchman! Well, what's it like to keep going in circles?"
Oh Mr. Watchman! Constantly running in circles? Maybe we should do that too.
Greetings to you!
I don't know you! So there's some variety here!
"Oh, (cough-cough), nice perfume. Do you have to soak yourself in it for it to work?"
"Silent night, muggy night. I'm standing here looking pretty. No one comes to talk to me, so I'm standing here alone..."
"Lonely girl, pretty, alone, in the middle of Bravil. And nobody talks to me. Hey you there?! How about it?!"
How are you?
"Come here, pay or leave."
I stand here. Dum-dum.
"Oh, you're the new smell! I was wondering where that scent of soap was blowing from!"
Anatos Yuu-rim Thuul! They are coming! They hunt in the shadows and will emerge from the silver mirror!
Do not follow the path of shadows! Don't walk on the silver mirror before the witching hour! Don't follow the girl!
"Ah, my favorite customer has enlightened my little distressed store with his lightning countenance."
"Ah, my favorite customer has enlightened my little distressed store with her lightning countenance."
"Welcome sire! You are here to trade, and I am here to trade. So? are we trading?"
"Sire, welcome to Ma Syd Jun's Goods and More, we have what you're looking for and what we haven't got, we buy."
Nice ears! I'll give you 500 gold for one!
A customer! How nice. Can I delight you with a fun lotion?
Welcome! Are you here to get rid of a limb? Or to buy?
"Yes, yes, yes, I see you're not from Bravil and you're probably looking to buy two dozen feather and water breathing potions!"
You must be the one with the tongue. If you want you can have a seat. It's quick. Snap snap! And no more jabbering!
So you're from Kvatch? Did you bring me some body parts from the slaughter? No? Why are you bothering me then?
"A customer. A well-travelled man of the world! An art lover, a connoisseur, a collector of artifacts, a man who received the kiss of the muse!"
"By the gods, a Dibellan! A mistress of the muse. Have a wonderful good day, my dear!"
"Oh, no. Not a lizard, again."
"Hey, kitty! You don't have gold - you touch nothing here. Got that?! I know you folks!"
Ah! Now that's what I call a surprise! An orc with Telvanni dunmer tastes? Interested in a precious piece?
That's one fine looking cape you're wearing there.
You shouldn't fall into the misconception that there is no law in Bravil!
"I'm not interested in who you are. You won't be staying in Bravil for long, or perhaps forever!"
Now that's what I call a really ugly face! I haven't spoken to you!
New boots? Or new to Bravil?
Now what a pretty face. What are you looking at! I'm not talking to you!
"Leave me alone, Torro!"
Another member of Torro's Fools' Guild?!
"Actually, we don't serve Khajiit here. Because of the hair and the food. Do you understand?"
"Grab a seat, what do you want to drink?"
"Such a well-travelled adventurer as you, surely would buy a round of drinks for the locals?"
May I top up your drink honey?
Hi there!
"Just call me Melyssa, honey... one 'L' and a double 'S'."
"Well, I really don't understand why I bought this weird book. I like poetic language, but I thought there were riddles in here."
I really don't understand why I bought this strange book. There aren't any pictures in there at all. Oh I see. Yes. Something about riddles.
I actually wanted to put this Torro down. But then he smacked me in the nose! That rude guy!
Ha! I thought I'd brought more torches. But I must have mislaid them somewhere. And now I have to be here in the dark.
"Well now, I have the option to either stay in this cave forever with that pretty whistling skull, or I have to leave it behind."
Oh. Bravil has changed quite a bit though. A little run down since the last time I was here.
"Very pleased to make your acquaintance. I'm an adventurer, you know."
"I'm sure you want to tell me you have some problem you want me to help you with, in exchange for gold! Hmm? Ah. No?!"
Oh Bravil. The city of my heart.
I paid one hundred gold pieces to finally sleep with a woman again and all I can remember is this dream!
"It's an outrageous thing! This person charges me one hundred gold pieces, and what happens? She runs against the wall all the time!"
"Be an angel young one, and pre-chew a bit of this bread for me."
What do you mean my eyes aren't that good anymore! This is utter nonsense! Bravil got darker!
Oh! A young adventurer. I am very pleased to meet you!
"It's so nice to meet you. You are an adventurer too, right? Just like me!"
You are in my light!
"Bravil is a little bit rough for you, kid. So get out!"
"Eh, you are a beauty. Just wait at the Red Mare for me, I still got some business."
"So, you are the hero of Kvatch? Go for Melyssa and you become the hero of the local graveyard as well, pal."
"Listen, I've got a real hangover, so don't piss me off! just go away."
I thought you'd show up sooner or later.
A nice little outfit you are wearing there.
"Last time I saw you, you were in quite a bit of danger. Nice to see that you made it."
"You look quite familiar to me. Have you ever been to a small village named Skaal, on an island north of Morrowind?"
For crown and empire.
"Do you want Ygor to please you with a joke, Sira?"
"Why haven't the tapestries been patched yet! I gave specific orders to take down the tapestries, and clean them."
Why is the Knights' Hall still in such an unbearable state?
Are you the volunteer for cleaning the castle moat?
Are you the volunteer for cleaning the castle moat? Then hurry up!
"And now the hall will be swept, the frames will be polished and then the table will be set at one o'clock sharp!"
My Lord?
My Lady?
Sire?
Mistress?
What a fine day to collect taxes.
You look much prettier with your hair down.
Your most obedient servant.
"Your herald, sire."
Yes. Mmm. What is it?
"I hope this won't be a long conversation, after all you have duties!"
Yes. Mhm. What is it?
Aye!
"Stand there, make money, stand around more. That's the motto."
"So, do you just stand here all the time?"
"For the gods, you and country."
Hail to you!
"On guard, sire!"
Your grace?
"Oh, court life is so boring."
Would you like a cookie? I had it baked according to my instructions.
Now let me concentrate on this.


What else?
Nassantos! Durian! Fordandae! Uuhl! Aradosch! Daedranon! Dastott! Enturuul! Daedranon! Oblivion-portul! Ankot-Tuur!
Follow me to the mirror.
Will this end when everything is destroyed?
"Danger! Behind you! Hahahah! I got you, again! Are we a little nervous today?"
"Lava, mud, dark caves, creatures breathing fire. What do you think if I take the lead now?"
All right! Where's the gold?!
"We're partners, after all, right?"
"Believe me, someone like you is unlikely to get lost here. That necklace around your neck though..."
Don't leave me alone.
And always remember: be careful! There's another unused gibbet!
"Remain honest, sincere and always speak the truth and no harm will happen to you in this world!"
"If you'll excuse me, I'm off to Leyawiin Castle to check in and then the Imperial City for some rest and relaxation."
Beat it!
Go away and watch out for the big oak! (giggles)
Keep your head low and your nose wet! It's not possible to be any other way here.
"Yes, yes, yes. Farewell. I'll be working in that direction!"
See you soon! Or maybe not.
Respect the mirrors in the silver dress! The little witch will seduce you! She will lead you to evil!
No. No it's not possible yet. Stay here! Here with me!
Respect the mirrors in the silver dress! The little witch will seduce you! She will lead you to evil!
"We'll see you again, sire!"
"If you find yourself feeling tired of a part of your body, don't be afraid to stop by!"
I sense that we will meet again.
"Watch your legs, dear. Would be a shame if they fell between some goblin jaws."
Have a relaxing day and avoid the streets at night!
Have a nice day and please don't lick the door. Thanks.
"Glad you're going. Meow, meow, purr or whatever."
Go forth. Maybe we'll see each other again sooner than you'd like.
You can be sure that we will see each other again sooner or later!
Luckily you know the way out of town!
You know the city gate. So. Use it!
Just in case you want to cause more trouble around town?! Don't force yourself. A stake has just become free again!
Whatever you say.
Enjoy your day!
Sleep it off Torro!
"Yeah, and wipe your boots if you come back here! Or even better, go to the Lonely Suitor, the name suits you!"
Honor us again soon!
I hope you will honor us again soon!
I'll come back later.
"And I said to myself. Bring enough torches, I said. And now I've run out and everything is so dark! Hmm."
At my age it is already an imposition to get a quest  having to indulge in physical activities with young women!
Somehow I feel like every day is the same here.
"Farewell, young adventurer! One day we shall meet again in the halls of the gods, with mead and wine and women."
"Yes, is there a more beautiful life than the adventurer's life? I wish you all the best! And don't let an orc bite your ass!"
Enjoy yourselves and never forget the three most important things an adventurer needs! A sharp blade! A good shield! And soft toilet paper.
"If there were more brave adventurers like you, I could retire soon."
"Whenever you want some tips from an old veteran warrior, you know where to find me! Always in the heart of danger!"
"And if you can't do something, no problem. Come to me and I'll do it for you."
Yeah. Get out of my light!
Now get out and pollute the air somewhere else with your stench!
There are worse things!
"I'll bet we'll catch up again, in - uh - two or three days."
"Then watch out for the big stone, sire!"
"Then beware of the great oak, sire! Be on the lookout!"
"Respect the water nymphs, sire! They don't want your gold! Honor my words!"
"Yes, yes. I'll take care of everything. As always. As always, it's all up to me. And who can give the servants the instructions again? Me."
Your home is in the best of hands.
"Don't come near me. There's cobwebs in your hair, and something on your nose. Uh. Crap! I think you've got crap on your nose!"
"Well, I'll go back to work then."
"Well, it's time for me to move on."
We'll talk more later.
So! And now I still have things to do!
Your most obedient servant.
"Aye, sire. Very well, sire!"
At your command!
What time is it? Oh my gosh! I have to get my beauty sleep!
Farewell.
[Guttural coughs]
Somebody buy me a drink!
Get lost!
Not now!
So I think it's a rumor that we have a fair partnership! We don't talk much.
"Tell me, didn't you think it would make more sense to ask a local?"
"What rumors? Well, there's a rumor in Bruma that I've been hanged."
"Well I'll tell you now what I think, so never ask again! Women, women, women, gold! Gold, women, women, women, women. Mead! Maybe that's not very deep thinking, but it makes me happy!"
We don't judge foreigners by their appearance. It's how long they survive!
I heard they fished someone out of the swamps again. I really wonder who is so stupid as to go swimming there alone!
"Whenever you want to make someone disappear, just put him in a boat and let him go to the swamps. Whoosh! And gone!"
"I'm trying to work here! Now move on, before that nice guy in the golden armor over there assumes we're together or something."
They say the forces of Oblivion have flooded Kvatch. We say: Kvatch had a 'Bravilian experience'.
"Well, there's this Ma Syd Jun here. He owns a shop. Strange guy. I've never seen him around town."
"I knew an adventurer once. Oh my Sayjid. Alas, will we ever come together again?!"
Do you know Marwen? I saw how he cleaned up the Silverhome. I think with the new facade it looks much nicer.
I don't like party adventurers. They're already challenging enough on their own!
I'm dead bored. So dead bored that I might have an orc over for coffee...uh...no! Just dead bored. Not crazy. Bored.
Do you want to know the latest from Bravil? A beer bottle fell over back there five minutes ago.
"I don't like group adventurers, orcs are challenging enough on their own. Of course they pay the monster surcharge. And only in the dark, obviously!"
"Since the gate opened in front of the city, there hasn't been a new face. When will people be returning?"
"Oh Sayjid, yes! That was great. Since then there have been no more installment payments!"
"Yes, yes, yes, the silver mirror! He's everywhere! Stretches from Cheydinhal to Leyawiin."
"I know what you are looking for! You're looking for the little thing. The little thing, the little thing. Aina has one, and Ln has one! Yes, but you won't find it!"
I have it! Shhhh! No one must know I have it. Because it's here! Here! hehehe! Here! In the middle of the city!
[COUGH]
[SNIFF]
"There's a rumor going around, sire, some people say that Aeko has spoken, Sire."
Did you know that if you boil the skin of a bosmer it serves any lotion much better than the skin of a Scamp?
"Of course I'll tell you everything I know, if you'll help me test something. It's a transformation potion which keeps turning people inside out, I'm hoping I might have perfected the recipe at last."
Have you seen the gate outside the city? I haven't had access to that many Daedra ingredients in a long time!
I would share with you the place of a great treasure. If you would give me in exchange one of your legs.
No. Nothing here! You go to swamp hole! Dishes there!
"No, the Peryite statue in front of the house has no special use. But everyone loves to touch things. Heroes come from all over the place to touch it. Run away, come back to touch it again, and run away again. I have no idea why they're doing this."
"Did you know that there are three types of stone in Bravil? There is the common hollow stone, the brown swamp stone, the dirty wooden stone."
"There was an adventurer here the other day who claimed he had visions in the [QUOTE]Red Mare[QUOTE] bed! Do I look like someone who is interested in other people's private lives? See, that's what I'm saying!"
"Since that thief was staked, pickpocketing and robbery have decreased."
They say Kvatch was overrun. I wonder why they wanted such a dump.
"Ranzan Jun really gives me the creeps. Once in a while she shows up with a drink, that tastes like scamp-skin or nirnroot. Shakes your bones loose."
"Supposedly, Oblivion Gates are opening all over the land. They should give it a try here!"
"Bravil might not be the most beautiful city, but you can always find a warm place."
"Little Yana is our hometown sweetie. A real honorable lady. Many outsiders fall for her, and she always handles them all on her own. Never heard any bad thing about her... that's how I like it."
"I think it's a rumor that if you keep asking stupid questions like this, you'll live a long time!"
[QUOTE]Rumors[QUOTE]. Hah! That's another stupid human word!
Shh. Have you heard? There's an unused gibbet!
Ah! You are new to Bravil. So let me help you. See these ears? Means that I'm in charge here! Now we look at yours! And see: you are something between commoner and servant. That means you don't ask me for rumors but I tell you what to do.
The people from the Mages Guild have been banned here since the accident at the last full moon.
"Honey, if I told you all the news I had in my little head. Believe me, you don't have that much time in two lives!"
Osslas has some new books.
"Alas! Always the only rewards are swords, armor and the like. I'd really like to have just an ointment."
Do you know why there aren't any dragons in these areas? They're so fat they get caught in the trees when they try to land.
"Well, the young woman made it into the room today. Earlier she was a little confused and kept running into walls."
"I don't know what kind of world we live in these days. Previously, there used to be many more guilds, different creatures, we had holiday celebrations, and even carts you could travel around on instead of sitting on a horse."
"In the past, there were a lot of guilds. Not just a few puny, small guilds that hardly interest anyone anyway."
"If the guards would train a little, then they wouldn't lose every fight against even the smallest monsters!"
"Everything used to be so much better, you know! There were basements full of monsters to slay!"
Bravil looked very different when I was young. Not so... dark. Or maybe my eyesight is weakening.
"Well, to me, these caves all look the same. I don't know where I've been and where not!"
"For years now I've been searching for the most important, greatest artifact that exists on this plane! The fabulous, legendary rheuma-blanket."
"Actually I stopped telling that old tale over and over again. But it was on a misty, drizzly morning when I saw a black cat passing the street and then all of a sudden, the exact same cat passed the street again! The world is repeating itself, I thought."
I can still remember when one torch lasted the whole adventure! How are you supposed to keep up with all the changes!
"Listen, I may be in the city watch here. But that doesn't mean I like this city, so if one of those gates opens here, I'm leaving."
"Riia should just keep her cheeky mouth shut, otherwise one day I'll cut out her tongue!"
What do you mean [QUOTE]there are some gates to Oblivion opening[QUOTE]? It can't get any worse than here!
Ma Syd Jun has a sister who is just as crazy as he is. I have no idea what they want here in town!
"If you need something to grope, then go to the 'Red Mare'. But kindly keep your hands off Melyssa! Otherwise I'll cut them off for you!"
"I work for the Cyrodiillian Trade Delegation, so I travel a lot. Most recently, I was in Kvatch."
"Maybe I should inform you about the Dragon's Tongue, which is a little yellow flower to be found quite often around the Larsius River. Its alchemical effects gave it its name. The day will come when you will be pleased about this information."
Be careful when opening chests. Some require the locks to be placed in a vertical position before they will open safely.
Dragons. The last dragon that tried to eat me was a painted horse-drawn cart with a fireball-throwing black mage.
"One of my most uncomfortable experiences was being tied up on an Ayleid altar, while a beam of light from a dark crystal was burning through the stone, and a mage's henchman was slowly pushing the crystal to move the light beam closer toward me."
Now this blade cuts through bone like a knife cuts through butter.
"Do you know what a mole is? Yeah, they come quite seldom in this area, guess all the cougars eat 'em. Anyway... that's the story of a hungry mole."
"A man takes his dog for a walk, and meets a woman walking her dog. The man's dog says, [QUOTE]woof![QUOTE] The other dog turns to her mistress and says, [QUOTE]I was just going to say that.[QUOTE]"
"What's a drunken dark elf, sire? Well? A high elf!"
"Ah, I see! Here you come back from your adventures and carry all the dirt from some cave into the castle!"
You should start trying to find a man. A woman of good standing needs a strong man by her side!
"If you walked less in those 'airy' armors and a little more in that nice ruffled dress I embroidered for you, then..."
Oh child! If you walked less in those 'airy' armors and a little more in that nice ruffled dress...
"You need a wife, finally. How about the Countess of Bruma, she's a nice person!"
Do you always have to wear this armor? So you can't see your muscles at all. Or something else.
"As always, no one is responsible here but me! And of course everything just goes its chaotic course, this is nothing new!"
"I would see fit to stock up the pantry, our supplies of duck, lobster and caviar are about to run out!"
Don't hate your enemies. This impairs your judgement.
"A tax on bathing would be a good thing. When someone goes swimming, they pollute the water and thus harm the community."
"Sire, I humbly recommend keeping nothing in drawers except in your private quarters and bedchambers. The servants steal."
"Your knight companions, sire, have free use of the knight's quarters in the basement."
"The castle includes damsel Andrya Hypothete of Blackrock, two maids, two cooks and servant, half a dozen devoted guards..."
"From seven to ten, the servants are available for inspection in the throne room. One o'clock is lunch time until three."
"You are in excellent shape, sire."
A good choice.
"Don't talk, just stand around and pay attention, that's the motto. Not exactly challenging, but not exactly nerve-wracking either."
"Our blood for your life, sire. Of course this is not a rumor! This is our code. Yes, yes."
"Sire? I just wanted to thank you again personally for the pay increase, sire!"
"You've got what looks like a smashed scamp skull stuck to your boot, sire."
"We shoot at everything that moves, kill everything that doesn't speak and do our job!"
[SIGH] The mistress dresses splendidly again today.
May your mouth always speak the truth. May your sword always help the poor and weak!
Have you heard of the adventurer who got so confused on his travels that he tried to dive out of Leyawiin?
"My cousin from Bruma told me that her neighbor's brother-in-law, whose roommate is in the Anvil City Guard, has a friend who works in the emperor's palace!"
"They arrested my cousin, who is really only an in-law, because he claimed that he had conversations with stone statues in the forest."
I think the 'Mythic Dawn' is just a rumor.
Rumors? Oh thank you for asking! Did you hear that Kud-Ei of the Mages Guild in Bravil was having an affair with an Altmer named Henantier.
"Allegedly, Uriel Septim is not dead, but runs a small tavern north of Leyawiin disguised as an innkeeper, until the whole nightmare is over."
Have you heard? Someone from the Archaeology Guild is currently renting a room at the Twin Goblet Ale House. I wonder what they're doing here?
Did you hear about Lord Baldor's dead wife? Apparently her body was taken from the chapel undercroft the night before the funeral! Who would do such a thing?
I haven't seen Cyrus for quite some time. Did he leave town?
I heard that Lord Varian is not the only monster in disguise among the nobility of Skingrad.
Did you hear? Baron von Zarov seems to have disappeared! Nobody has seen him for days.











I don't know what you are talking about. I don't buy or sell things.
I only serve higher ranking Thieves Guild members. Go see Ongar in Bruma.
"I have many customers, sire, who sell me their salvage from the ruins, caves and mines. I can outfit an army, sire."
"Now, what do you want to buy?"
"Now, what are you trying to sell?"
"You have the goods, I have the gold, sire. What do you want to sell?"
"I see. So if I don't get a piece of you, we will see what pieces you hide in your pockets."
Hopefully this is worth the effort.
"For Bravilians, I have special discounts and bulk offers!"
"Barter. Of course, that's my third biggest interest."
Very well.
"Your tongue, is in my... Thank you."
"You want to trade? Good! But listen! I don't take glass beads, I only deal in gold. Do you understand?"
Nice to have you here.
"May I top up your drink, honey?"
"Sire, why're you waving your hand around, like a mage? I am no dunmer, sire, that mind-trick does not work with me, only gold. So, no gold, no parts, no deal!"
"Dear, do not dare me to lose my good manners."
"In case the gold is missing from your pouch, I'm sure I can find something on or in you that would make an excellent potion!"
"Ha, ha, ha, that's supposed to be a joke, right?"
"This isn't Black Marsh, my scaly friend!"
"No, no, no. You have to make a better offer. Uhm. Wrong gold. You must say more gold. Do you understand that?"
That's all?
Sire?
What am I supposed to do with all that junk!
Oh great. I've never seen one of those before.
An excellent deal!
"Oh how nice, you licked it! That's disgusting."
"Yes, you're buying. Now you give me gold! Listen! I get gold now!"
Was that it?

"You are my favorite customer, sire!"
"Yes sire, that's a good deal!"
Oh. What treasures! What should I do with that... 'junk'?
"A splendid choice, my friend!"
"Yes, take it if you like it. And quietly lick it. How nice. And? Does it taste good?"
I buy. Yes. You're good at making trades. You're a real dealer.
Thanks.

"Good, sire. Enough trade, sire!"
"See you again, sire!"
"Well, that was the best deal of my life!"
It's been a pleasure!
"Yes, how nice... and moist."
"Thank the gods we put that behind us. Uh, you're good at trading. You good kitty!"
This one's on the house!
Thank you very much.
What a pity.
"Really interesting story, but you somehow misunderstood the [QUOTE]do everything[QUOTE] part!"
[COUGH]
Hmm.
"I feel sorry for you, creature. Uh, being, uh, speaking thing, uhm, I mean whatever you call yourself."
"Strange. Everyone else just seems to get stronger, smarter, and better with age. I'm the only one who has Reuma."
You are in my light!
How unsuitable.
Honestly?
"Quick, quick! Be so good and hurry up a little! We don't have all day, after all!"
I don't have the time to explain this to you in a way that your intellectual capacity might understand!
"Well, well, well."
It may seem like I'm not doing anything here. But I don't have the time to explain this to you in a way that your intellectual capacity might understand!
I could swear someone just shouted [QUOTE]Skooma for everyone[QUOTE]?! Has it been a month already?
Why should we be afraid of them? They should fear us!
There are people who are afraid of Oblivion. The rest are from Bravil.
[SNIFF]
"If they try to get into Bravil, we'll give them a welcome that makes Oblivion seem like paradise!"
"Just tell me where you want it! High, or low?"
"Gates open, gates close. And in between there is a lot of noise, blood and dirt. So? How is that different from here? Well? That's what I'm saying!"
"Yes, yes! All of a sudden these gates are appearing all over the land! One appeared just as I... when I... well. When I was about to relieve myself."
Are you talking to me?
It won't get any worse here like it did in Kvatch. It's already a dump without being invaded by Daedra.
"On, on, on! A new lease of life!"
I don't have the time to explain this to you in a way that your intellectual capacity might understand!
"Well, well, well."
"Don't talk, just stand around and pay attention, that's the motto. Not exactly challenging, but not exactly nerve-wracking either."
It may seem like I'm not doing anything here. But I don't have the time to explain this to you in a way that your intellectual capacity might understand!
Just keep going! And you're in the swamp before you can say mud crab!
Why is everyone talking to me? Haven't you got a home?!
Where's Ygor when you need him?
"I know what you are looking for! You're looking for the little thing. The little thing, the little thing. Aina has one, and Ln has one! Yes, but you won't find it!"
Move on quickly and don't make trouble in the city!
Just tell me where you want it! High or low?
This conversation will not save you from paying your debts! We aren't putting things on the slate anymore!
"In the good ol' days everything was so much better, kid."
"Damn, it smells like rotten fish in here. Must be you!"
How unsuitable.
"On, on, on! A new lease of life!"
I don't have the time to explain this to you in a way that your intellectual capacity might understand!
I will not tolerate this any more!
I'd rather make out with a scamp!
Why seek far afield when good things are so close?
That is wonderful.
Why is everyone talking to me? Haven't you got a home?!
"Really interesting story, but you somehow misunderstood the [QUOTE]do everything[QUOTE] part!"
I have it! Shhhh! No one must know I have it. Because it's here! Here! hehehe! Here! In the middle of the city!
That reminds me of my mother's good ol' burned cookies.
"I would prefer a pot of gold, and that doesn't even come close to it, but... that is nice of you."
Well.
So this is the most charming day of your life. Thank you for lettin' me be part of it!
Almost as nice as cruising across the Nibenay in a rudderless boat for two.
Honestly?
I don't really have anything to say to that.
An offer I wouldn't turn down.
"Well, well, well."
Is there something important?
What time is it? Oh my gosh! I have to get my beauty sleep!
Surprising like a stranger's pocket. You never know what you'll get.
Yes. Interesting. Did you know that there are 3920 paved stones on this square?
Where's Ygor when you need him?
[SNIFF]
Hmm.
I may be a wood elf. But that doesn't mean I have spent my whole life with a drum circling around a pine tree.
Honestly?
"Everything used to be so much better, kid."
Really? I am deeply touched.
Quite impressive.
Of course.
I don't have the time to explain this to you in a way that your intellectual capacity might understand!
Incredible!
Shhh. Here he comes!
Of course. And I'm just on my way to the Chapel of Mara to become a priest.
"Yes, yes. And at night the Dark Brotherhood comes and dances with the Thieves Guild around the Old Lady. Of course!"
I'm dead bored.
Noooo!
That reminds me of my mother's good ol' burned cookies.
I may be a wood elf. But that doesn't mean I have spent my whole life with a drum circling around a pine tree.
This conversation will not save you from paying your debts! We aren't putting things on the slate anymore!
Alas! We live in a world without music.
Get your stupid face somewhere else!
"We can't all be geniuses, can we?"
"Two high elves are sitting on a bridge. One says, [QUOTE]now let me be in the middle[QUOTE]."
Not at all.
"No, no, no, no, no."
Absolutely not.
What can I say? I'm a guard!
Is that a joke?
"Really? Wait a moment... Is there a new face in town? No. No. I know him. What a shame, those are really nice boots. Yes? What were you saying?"
"Listen, I'm not just standing here thinking, [QUOTE]Somebody should fill the air with chatter![QUOTE]"
Dum-dum-dubidi-du?
Yeah!
So there was finally a reason for getting up early.
I hear you.
"Some days, I want to move to Oblivion too."
Somehow I feel like every day is the same here.
"So, lucky you, I guess."
Never say never.
What is green and red and bounces in circles around the woods? An orc in a bear trap.
Of course.
"Go on, go on."
Incredible.
"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
Shhh. Here he comes!
Of course. And I'm just on my way to the Chapel of Mara to become a priest.
Read my lips: NO!
"Really interesting story, but you somehow misunderstood the [QUOTE]do everything[QUOTE] part!"
Noooo!
"There's not much to say, everyone can see the city is going to the dogs!"
"I don't have the time to explain this to you in a way that your intellectual capacity might understand. So let's say, uhm, no?!"
This conversation will not save you from paying your debts! We aren't putting things on the slate anymore!
"Everything used to be so much better, kid."
I bet your mother taught you how to fight?!
Incredibly interesting.
"A Bosmer visits a marketplace in Black Marsh. There is a trader selling brain. The Bosmer wonders what [QUOTE]brain[QUOTE] should be good for so he asks the trader who explains, [QUOTE]see if you eat brain you raise your own brain capacity.[QUOTE]"
Out of the question!
"No, no, no, no, no."
I doubt it!
Not necessarily.
It may seem like I'm not doing anything here. But I don't have the time to explain this to you in a way that your intellectual capacity might understand!
Clear as a shadow crystal in the moonlight.
It's not possible otherwise.
Dum-dum-dubidi-du?
Yeah!
"As my old lord always said, with salt and pepper you can eat anything."
You said it. Whatever you said. What did you say?
Was that it?
Well.
You'd better go to a cave and talk to some troll!
"As always, a pleasure to hear about."
What do you call an intelligent creature in Black Marsh? A tourist!
Of course.
"Go on, go on."
"Please, go on."
Aye!
Even a trained troll can do that!
"If I didn't have anything better to do like embroider, eat or sleep, I would say [QUOTE]yes[QUOTE]."
"What a lovely amulet! No, that is beautiful! It's wonderful. Gorgeous! That metal! That shape! What excellent casting..."
How are you? Now you take your right foot and put it in front of your left. You can practice this by turning around and just [QUOTE]going[QUOTE]!
"Listen, I'm not just standing here because I think the Chapel of Mara is pretty."
"I pray, praise the gods."
"The weather is good, the wind carries away the rotten smell of the streets, and the mosquitoes are taking it easy today. These are the really great days of Bravil!"
Me wood elf. You hum-an. Does that solve our communication problem?
Was that it or do you want something else?
Thank you.
"Ah yes, the good ol' days. There really were a lot of guilds. Sometimes I didn't know which I was in. But, never mind!"
"Like a worm at the bottom of an empty beer mug, is how you will feel if you do not stop bugging me."
"My job involves staying hidden and leaving the glory to others. Like Ghostgate, Skaal and most recently Kvatch."
What is a Khajiit with no arms? Someone you can trust!
"Two Imperial Legion border guards are walking down the borderline to Elsweyr. Suddenly they spot three Khajiit border guards kicking each other between the legs. [QUOTE]Uh, doesn't it hurt?[QUOTE] asks one of the legion men. [QUOTE]No, we got iron boots[QUOTE]."
I don't really have anything to say to that.
An offer I wouldn't turn down.
Incredible.
What can I say? I'm a guard!
It may seem like I'm not doing anything here. But I don't have the time to explain this to you in a way that your intellectual capacity might understand!
"Is your ring made of real gold? Oh, no. Forget about it."
I think we have a rat problem here in Bravil. There! Another one!
Who actually owns all these pigs?
[COUGH]
I see.
Shhh! It's listening.
Oh yes. But it's actually quite good that I don't have to go into every single cave anymore. I just choose one and I know I'll find some treasure. There is always treasure hidden in every cave. Always.
So?
Incredibly interesting.
"Wait, I have to count for a moment. One, three, seven? Yes. No. Um. Eight. Yes. Yes! What did you want to say?"
"Quick, quick! Be so good and hurry up a little! We don't have all day, after all!"
"No, no, no, no, no."
"Well, well, well."
"Yes, yes, yes, yes!"
Why seek far afield when good things are so close?
I heard they fished someone out of the swamps again. I really wonder who is so stupid as to go swimming there alone!
"The emperor is dead, long live the emperor! But the likes of us have to work hard to earn our coin."
I could swear someone just shouted [QUOTE]Skooma for everyone[QUOTE]?! Has it been a month already?
"If I threw a stick, would you bring it back to me?"
"Did you hear that Osslas said he wants to stop selling books? Because every time he has a customer, he has to clean up the whole bookstore! Why are people so rude?"
"So since you're asking me, I've had this horrible swamp cold for some time! The alchemists say it's deadly, but that's what they said about my neighbor's skin rash, and he's in a lovely grave now."
Some people say Ygor is crazy. But they are the same ones trying to break into a house somewhere! Makes me angry.
If you want to have fun with the ladies here... go ahead! Life is short!
"Behave with the ladies, be kind to the barmaids, pay your fines and do not pick flowers from the graveyard."
"Yes, Ygor is quite funny. I used to tell jokes too. But no one wanted to hear it through. So I gave up."
Isn't this a fine peaceful day?
"Why is everyone asking me about red foxes? Ah, the Gray Fox. I thought it had something to do with me being a wood elf."
There is no thieves guild! And if I had any information on this subject I wouldn't talk about it. Gotta go!
Shhh. Have you heard? There's an unused gibbet!
"Wait, I have to count for a moment. One, three, seven? Yes. No. Um. Eight. Yes. Yes! What did you want to say?"
What do you want to know?
How come some only get better with age while people like me have to put up with all these ailments?
"Well, how are you supposed to come up with something like that? If you move a statue, then it has to move too! How else are you supposed to know?!"
"I believe that all caves are really empty, except for the one you're going to. And wherever you're about to go, all the monsters run there quickly before you!"
It seems like the good city guards never train or even practice combat in any way. How do they get so good?
The emperor is dead. So what? Do you think this will change anything for us?
Ygor! If I could I'd beat the shit out of him. But... somehow he's a favorite of Marwen.
Anything unusual happened lately?
It's a pity that there are no more card games in the Swamphole.
A nice toy that you carry with you there.
"Yes, yes, yes. The old game of cat and mouse."
"A human merchant crawls through the Khajiit desert, [QUOTE]water, water![QUOTE] A Khajiit trader approaches on his horse. The human goes [QUOTE]water, water![QUOTE] The Khajiit replies [QUOTE]I cannot give you some water but if you want I can sell you a fine fur robe.[QUOTE]"
I miss the receptions and jousting tournaments. Oh how nice it used to be when two heroes fought each other on the field of honor.
Dinner was excellent again today.
We have tadpoles in the pond again. Those are adorable little creatures with their little tails! Have you seen them?
I can't shake the feeling we have a rat in the castle.
Who hung my underpants in the wine cellar? I see this as a personal attack on my... person!
Stand at attention! Back straight and eyes forward!
"As I see it, the young lady is again busily not being busy!"
"Our mistress is quite a sweetheart, isn't she?"
I'm all for giving us full armored steel suits with visors. Then we could stand them here and have a nice day.
"If you want to get together later, I'm free at six."
Who is actually in the lead when shooting from the battlements? The guard? Rantim?
There's supposed to be a free gibbet in Bravil again. And the odds are high that the owner of the house next to the bow maker will claim it.
"Sorry, I wasn't listening? The stone on your ring casts such a beautiful reflection."
"Yes, yes. Morrowind is such a joke."
Black Marsh. Endless vastness. Swamp as far as the eye can see. What could you do with it?
"Argonians and Khajiit, I'm 'not' interested. That's what my mother always said."
The only thing I can say is: dum-dum-dubididu! Do you want to tell me some more interesting things like that now?
"If I threw a stick, would you bring it back to me?"
"Really interesting story, but you somehow misunderstood the [QUOTE]do everything[QUOTE] part!"
"Yes, the Argonians are a really interesting race. I find them even more interesting in their homeland!"
Do you know Marwen? I saw how he cleaned up the Silverhome. I think with the new facade it looks much nicer.
"So since you're asking me, I've had this horrible swamp cold for some time! The alchemists say it's deadly, but that's what they said about my neighbor's skin rash, and he's in a lovely grave now."
"As my old lord always said, with salt and pepper you can eat anything."
"Do you know all five ways to die? You can suffocate, drown, burn, freeze - and finally - be 'Marwened'."
"Some days, I want to move to Oblivion too."
"Well, in Morrowind, it was a lot easier to travel. I'm too old for horses!"
Go into a cave somewhere and let a troll crush you!
"If I told you something about that, I'd have to kill you."
"All I'm saying is: ash storms, swamp flies and giant mushrooms! I visited there once and ten horses couldn't drag me back again!"
"Ah, Black Marsh. We used to have a hunting lodge there, before the riots started. Now we don't have a hunting lodge anymore."
I love snow!
"I got another letter from an old childhood friend, a Bosmer. Telvanni Mage now. Lives on Morrowind and is currently traveling around Black Marsh."
"So if they weren't so hairy, I could see myself owning a striped one. Or a white one maybe. They're so pretty!"
I was just thinking of those flying lizards of Morrowind? What were they called again?
"What can I tell you? Ash storms, swamp flies and giant mushrooms! Ten horses couldn't drag me back again!"
"The lizards! Yes, they are lovely, aren't they? We used to have several Argonian slaves when I was a child."
We need to take a trip to the north again soon. My red fox muff is starting to get moths.
"Oh these Bosmer are always so handsome and well brought up. I used to have one, but that... that was before."
"I really wonder why the skooma trade isn't legalized and taxed. In Bravil, you can get that stuff on the street anyway!"
"Morrowind is an uncivilized, filthy and racist province. In my opinion, these Dunmer should be exterminated."
"The Argonians are extremely friendly, helpful and loving people. If only they didn't smell so bad."
I consider those Nords to be uncivilized!
"It is Bosmer, not 'Bosmer'. The correct pronunciation is Bosmer. The emphasis is on the second syllable. One also does not say 'Dunmer'."
Speaking of which. Do you have any Skooma left that I could trade you for?
"Courier service reported that they plundered in Morrowind again, a trader was massacred and eaten."
Who actually owns the Argonian egg that's magically moving from room to room and isn't where it's supposed to be?
"It's drafty here like in Bruma, why can't you just keep the main door locked? All the water comes in..."
So these Bosmer jokes that are coming back into fashion are really outrageous. It's all those old Leyawiin jokes just the other way around.
"Well, I really can't stand those Khajiit. Always those big teeth and that penetrating smell of meat coming out of the mouth!"
When will Swamp-Tongue Soup be available again?
"Oh, the service in Morrowind was great. Eggs in the morning, eggs in the evening. Boiled egg, fried egg, egg on a skewer and sometimes even more..."
A friend of mine is a nude dancer there.
Altmers are nice. But I like most of them horizontally with a shovel of dirt in their mouths about two or three meters below me.
Oh yeah! And what comes after the Skooma tax? A road tax?
It's like Morrowind here.
I think Rantim leads at 34 when shooting from the battlements. But only because an Argonian caravan passed the day before yesterday!
Apparently they started the war again in the north.
Did you hear? Looks like they hung another Altmer in Bravil!
With the fluff on the carpet you could easily believe a Khajiit lives here. A lint tax would be nice!
Why seek far afield when good things are so close?
"Yes, the Argonians are excellent workers. Talk little, work hard and obedient to leash handling."
Ugh. There's a cat hairball in the library so big you'd think it came from a Khajiit.
"Oh, if there's anything more obnoxious than those purring bipeds, it's those squeaky-voiced Bosmer halflings."
A little bit of snow would do me good too. This hot weather is affecting my circulation.
"Jumping worms, giant bugs, flying jellyfish. To the gods, this island must look like an Argonian dining table."
A skooma tax. That would be a good idea.
"I remember that we used to wear these little Bosmer ear chains. Unfortunately, this is out of fashion again."
Today is the anniversary of the death of one of my cousins. Died in a knife fight in Bruma.
"I still remember living there, at that time there was a dispute with the Morag Tong. A very dirty business."
There is so much dirt on the floor here that you could think you are in Black Marsh.
"Such a handsome, rich Dremora lord? Who knows what other treasures there might be down there?"
This subject interests me as much as the snow conditions of Bruma!
Did you know that there are 3920 paved stones on this square?
Let them try to get into this city. I'm looking forward to it!
"Gates? Oh yes, the Oblivion gates are everywhere! Sure!"
"Gates open, gates close. And in between there is a lot of noise, blood and dirt. So? How is that different from here? Well? That's what I'm saying!"
"Oh yes. The circle of nature. The deer are eaten by the wolves. The wolves by the mountain lions, and the mountain lions by the wild boar. And finally, the wild boar are eaten by the deer. Circle of nature."
What do you mean [QUOTE]there are some gates to Oblivion opening[QUOTE]? It can't get any worse than here!
"Ah, those Oblivion Gates, I've seen worse at the Ghostgate."
"I've seen a good book that had a mother-of-pearl cover, with small gold reliefs around the title and in the middle such a large topaz!"
Was it expensive?
You read books? Just asking. I didn't know you could read.
Do I look like I'm reading?
"I read [QUOTE]Auril's Riddle Rhymes[QUOTE]. It was not so hard to solve. I wrote the lines down on paper, and the answer just came to me. Now there's a nice paper boat floating down the river."
"No, back off with your questions! Depart! Leave me!"
(Cough)
I'm thinking of arranging public readings of [QUOTE]Law and Punishment[QUOTE]. At least those lousy illiterates should know why we chop their heads off.
"Put it back where you got it from, if you are done with it. I am not the god-damned librarian of 'Osslas' Scripts'."
I read a good book called Killing With Two Fingers. Do you want a demonstration?
Sounds nearly as interesting as [QUOTE]Killing Without a Trace[QUOTE].
Nice that you have time to read.
I miss the old cake recipes.
"I read the Debtors Guide recently, and guess whose name was on the first page?"
Why don't you read my lips for a moment: move - out - of - my - sight!
At the moment I'm busy deciphering old Ruunian literature. An extremely interesting hieroglyphic script.
"I really would love to talk about books, but regrettably my time does not match my interest."
"With our meager library, I probably won't get to read any more books."
Do you know 'Auril's Magic Riddle Rhymes'? I love this book. In addition to 'Law and Punishment' - an absolute must-read.
"An old friend of mine always liked to read. Unfortunately, an enemy dealer then foisted poisonous tomes on him."
I'm currently reading [QUOTE]The Brother-in-Law[QUOTE]. A truly authentic story.
"I read the Commandments of the Nine once a year and, for amusement, The Adventures of Captain Ansol. A really likeable scoundrel!"
"Someone slipped extremely questionable pages under my pillow, which clearly showed naked Breton women! Funny!"
"Ah, books! Ah, books! I enjoy these nice Argonian wall paintings much more, which unfortunately are far too few here."
"Reading is fine if you can read. I wanted to learn it, but I'm having a hard time with the letter 'J'."
"If I wasn't so busy knitting, eating or sleeping all day, I would read more."
Someone ripped out the pictures from 'Breton Nights'!
"Hm. I'm really hungry. Do they serve mud crab today in the Swamphole or is it rat again? I guess it's rat. One day they had this delicious mud crab and onion sauce, was it Middas, or Mondas?"
"In my opinion goblins are the natural link between animals and orcs. Same color, same teeth, same unforgettable breath. It's so obvious to me. I even think I once saw an orc related to a goblin. All the same green folks."
That's the reason why I only work within the walls.
Did you know that mud crabs can eat a human in less than an hour? I have seen it with my own eyes. Impressive!
"Goblins? They're incredibly resourceful. If they find, say, an unconscious person. Loot him, skin him, eat him and..."
Mud crabs! Mud crabs are great! On Morndas they serve at the Swamp Hole mud crabs fried with an onion sauce. Delicious!
"Once, I ate something that tasted like goblin."
I am starving. Guess I'll quit early and get some mud crab at the Swamp Hole today.
Why is everyone always talking about mud crabs and goblins? Are they allowed into the city now?!
"Do you know, I think if we trained the goblins we could use them as slaves. They would be great slaves in my opinion."
I once had what tasted like mud crabs and goblins.
"Yesterday some goblins tried to play games near the east gate. I really love those little critters with their tiny, skinny arms and their big baby-like boom-hands. Lots of screaming and yelling, pure fun!"
That's why we pour poison in the river channel. Keeps the beasties out and the crabs down.
"If you can cook it, you can eat it."
"Oh, they are so yummy!"
They are much easier to dress than mud crabs.
I once tried to dress a mud crab. But it became the most horrible salad of my life.
I wish we would have another [QUOTE]Goblin River Channel Day[QUOTE]. I found such a nice stick.
"Honey, if I had to tell you about all the news buzzing around in my little head... well trust me, even two lives of yours won't suffice for that."
"Well, as for me... I am quite glad that there are still some mud crabs and rats out there. I mean, what else could we put on our menus instead?"
"So there was this rat once. And it was a really mean rat, she bit my butt. So I went into town and trained. I trained really hard, so that if I meet that rat again I could really bite into its buttocks."
"Yes, yes There is a cure for all sorts of things. Antidotes, healing potions! But something against haemorrhoids? I haven't received that to this day."
"It creeps me out. I could train day and night but I've got the feeling those monsters become stronger just as I do, too."
So you don't get along with your family.
I see mud crabs everyday on my guard shift.
"It already smells like a goblin cave here, so why don't we let them all in?!"
"If I have to get another crab-slaughtered corpse out of the bay, I'm going to quit."
Very ambitious and low-minded creatures.
"I prefer mud crabs in a Cyrodiilian liquor glass. Shaken, not stirred."
"Yesterday a bunch of very disappointing goblins took part in a vastly messy gathering at the West Weald. Always interesting how goblins fall under the influence of any hypocritical mage trying to endanger the empire, don't you think?"
"I just thought about that song about three blind mud crabs, trying to dissect the cook with a carving knife? Do you remember its tune?"
"Yes, yes, crabs are everywhere."
"No, no. They fear her!"
Mudcrabs. I saw them in the mirror as I protected it from her.
"The Goblins fear her. If she is near, they hide in their shadows."
"And the horns! So big! Well, some of the champions of creation can learn something from them."
"Well, minotaurs do have impressive muscles. Goblins, on the other hand, are so scrawny."
I had a cousin once who made a lot of money fighting minotaurs in the arena.
The minotaur cutlet was delicious as well as thick. Minotaurs like that really have hefty back meat.
I am of the view that these lesser creatures receive far too much attention!
"If I catch the one who put the burning Minotaur cake in front of my door, then there will be trouble!"
"Minotaurs are really something fine. You can hang their heads on the wall, you can grind their hooves to make an aphro... aphri... uh. For sexual enhancement..."
Not to mention the delicious back meat. It's a special treat.
"Minotaurs are really something fine. You can hang their heads on the wall, turn their hooves into aphrodisiacs and their fur..."
And so cute how they always chase the flies away with their little tails!
Another Minotaur drowned this morning while trying to graze the moat.
I hope the room meets your needs.
"Yes, there's a room available. It'll cost 15 gold for the night. Are you interested?"
We have a room for two. Will this do?
You already have a room.
"I have a room ready for you. It's 50 gold a night, what do you say?"
"Sorry, I don't give refunds."
"You drunkard, too sauced to remember already renting a room huh? Would you be interested in buying that shirt of mine you're wearin'?"
"Shiver me timbers, it's a room you want is it? I got one available, 10 gold for a night's stay. What do you say land lover?"
I have a room you could rent for 10 gold a night. What do you say?
"It's upstairs, second room on the left."
"I have a lovely room you could rent for the night, for a mere 40 gold."
"You already have a room, I couldn't possibly rent a second room to you, what if someone else wanted to rent a room?"
"There's a most comfortable bed, priced at 25 gold a night, if you're interested."
Hope it suits you.
"I have a room upstairs. It's yours for a night if you want it, for 10 gold."
You already rented a room. What more do you want?
"I only know one thing, if that happened in my graveyard, I would take that ghost and throw it in the river. What's dead should remain dead, and not walk around like an idiot!"
"Well sire, rumor has it that there are people who mistake Marwen for the gray fox. But I can assure you, Marwen is entirely law abiding."
"Then have some more ale friend, always room at the bar."
"Alright, go up to the second floor, the first door on your left."
"No gold, no room, sorry."
"Right then. Head up the stairs, it's the first door on your right."
"I'm not running a charity here, you know? I need the gold, so you come back when you actually have it."
"Unless you can pay for it, you're not staying in one of my rooms."
"Very good. It's up the stairs there, first door on your left. Sleep well."
"You will certainly enjoy... wait, you don't have 40 gold? I can't possibly rent it for less, you'd better find one of the cheaper inns somewhere else in the city."
"You will certainly enjoy your stay! Just go up the stairs, through the dining room to the far door. Your room is the middle one on the right."
"Oh dear me, you must have a hole in your money pouch! Do come back when you can afford the room."
"Thank you. The room is upstairs, the second door."
"Sorry mate, no gold, no room. Maybe you can find something cheaper in town."
Very good! Go upstairs to the very top floor. Enjoy your stay.
What is this!?! You think ol' Peg Head doesn't know how to count do ya? Well you better be gone from here before you wake up chained to a rudder!
"Very good, it'll be the first door on your left. Nevermind the sounds coming up from the basement, it's just the creaking of the stone settling."
What? No money? Then get out.
Your room is upstairs. Second door.
Mhm.
"Have I ever told you, that you remind me of my pet Argonian I had as a child? I hated it!"
I know that it is actually an advantage to touch everything. But I didn't even know I had moved them.
"If you want something to stare at, then go to the Red Mare and keep your eyes off me!"
We're dealing with it.
The [QUOTE]Mythic[QUOTE] Dawn? All destitute. Believe me. I know it.
"Wahoo. Oh, yes. Mythic [QUOTE]dawn[QUOTE]. I saw a lot of [QUOTE]mythical[QUOTE] dawns. Very scary, yeah, yeah. Whatever."
The only thing I can say is: Dum-Dum-Dubididu! Do you want to tell me some more interesting things like that now?
This topic interests me as much as the snow conditions of Bruma!
"The Mythic Dawn are like the common cold. No matter how many times they're wiped out, they keep coming back."
Shh!
"Well, somehow you have to touch the statue! And if you don't know if it has moved, you have to touch it somewhere else!"
"If you want something to stare at, then go to the Red Mare and keep your eyes off me!"
It is only a matter of time before the head of the Mythic Dawn is once again eliminated in some unthinkable way.
I'm looking forward to a little change!
I don't have the time to explain this to you in a way that your intellectual capacity might understand!
"What do you mean, you grabbed the statue's breasts? Something would have happened then, right? Oh, did a secret door open?"
The emperor is dead. So what? Do you think this will change anything for us?!
It is only a matter of time before the head of the Mythic Dawn is once again eliminated in some unthinkable way.
They say the forces of Oblivion have flooded Kvatch. We say: Kvatch had a 'Bravilian experience'.
"I would love to see some scamps playing around through the streets, with their little lightning fireballs. That would be exciting."
There are people who are afraid of Oblivion. The rest are from Bravil.
"If they try to get into Bravil, we'll give them a welcome that makes Oblivion seem like paradise!"
I may be a wood elf. But that doesn't mean I have spent my whole life with a drum circling around a pine tree.
"If the guards would train a little, then they wouldn't lose every fight against even the smallest monsters!"
There are plenty of other people in the city! Why do you need to talk to me?!
We're dealing with it.
So you think you want to try your luck out on the vast Abecean Sea huh?
"Thanks, here's your receipt and cabin keys. Her name is the Evening Star, and she's anchored just out to sea."
Use the row boat outside my shop to reach her.
"Fine, go [QUOTE]earn[QUOTE] some more money! I buy any and all goods."
We heard that you have been tasked with something new.
"That's our job. Anyway, we need details on what you are doing."
Really? What's the purpose of the Rangers in some ruins?
And you didn't think about asking?
Not the curious type I see... well tell me about these ruins.
That is not much to go on... we will contact you again if we need you.
What did you expect?
"Well that's how it works: you get a task from the Rangers, you explain to us what it is and we provide you with some tasks of our own to accomplish. Nothing more..."
Assassinations? Fireworks? We are not in the business of being seen but gathering information.
There is nothing much exciting about it; we need people at the right places and you are just where we need you right now so just open your ears. That's all we really need from you.
"Elsweyr? No ship from here docks at Duncori Walk, but you can be dropped off as one passes."
That's 40 gold. The trip should take about six hours.
Members of the Imperial Legion can sail from the Imperial City for free. The trip should take about six hours.
"It is unusual these days for legionaries to head to Elsweyr, and no ship from here docks at Duncori Walk, but one can drop you off as it passes."
Move along then. Next!
...You don't have enough money.
Get out of my sight!
"Carry on, then legionary."
"Oh? That's unusual. Duncori Walk, you say? Well, Elsweyr! I guess a ship could drop you off as it passes."
"I reckon it'll take around four hours to sail there, you can pay 20 gold for the trip."
"I hope you're packed for the desert! Oh, and I hope the ship's crew doesn't just dump you in the water as they sail passed!"
"Hang on, that's not enough gold! You'll have to walk!"
"Oh, that's in Elsweyr in the desert isn't it? No? It's on the coast? I didn't know that. Hmm, no ships travel directly there from Anvil."
One could always drop you off as it sails passed I suppose.
"You'll have to pay the same as when traveling to Leyawiin, 150 gold. I think it would take about eleven hours to get there."
I think I have cousins in Duncori Walk! Perhaps you will meet them?
"Hey, you don't have enough money! You're not sailing to Elsweyr!"
"It seems this is your lucky day cabin boy, I just bought a ship off a retired pirate."
"I would be willing to part with her for say... 25,000 gold."
"It seems this is your lucky day cabin girl, I just bought a ship off a retired pirate."
"I would be willing to part with it for say... 25,000 gold."
"Enjoy the voyage, but let the captain know if you spot any pirates!"
"Hang on, that's not enough gold! You'll have to swim!"
"The kingdom of Ruun? You walk old paths, sire, forgotten ones. Yes, I know the legend, sire. I haven't told it in a long time..."
"The last king of Ruun, Ardan, in battle with the dragonborn, refused to make a pact with the gods."
Refused to unleash mighty powers from the forgotten days. When Ruun was crushed by the claws of the Dragonborn...
Their temples where the priests lived were sealed and forgotten. Far from the glory of life.
"And just as they found no way out, there is no way in. See for yourself, Sire!"
"There is a book from the old days of Akatosh. A prize of friendship, sire. Available for a little gold."
No! Sayjid. You have the honor with yours truly. A little lonely at the moment after [QUOTE]that thing[QUOTE] out there killed Vran and Rangor.
"And very busy with the [QUOTE]syllables of the ancestors[QUOTE]! You don't happen to be conversant in Old Ruun dialect, do you? - Step aside, then!"
"I don't know anything about [QUOTE]Forgotten Realms[QUOTE], but there is more gold behind this door than in the tower of Rangit! Enough for both of us I guess."
Shall we say seventy-thirty? For shutting up and letting me work?!
What's that supposed to mean? I came across this dream by accident. Otherwise I would never have gone into a house like this.
Guess why the Forgotten Realm is called the 'Forgotten' Realm?!
You had a vision?
Oh! That's charming!
"So, you tell me you dreamed of two men?"
"Oh no wait, one was a dunmer!"
Well.
Thanks for sharing. But these are things I really don't need to know...
At all!
Enjoy your stay.
"Sire is back with the blade of forgotten steel. I'll make you a fair deal sire, if you want to sell it."
"But wait, sire. Before I forget. There was a man who wants to talk to you. He said he stays at the Black Arrow Tavern, that is the tavern down by the river. I guess you'll want to talk to him."
Lead you to fame and me to gold!
"You lead I follow, you say 'wait' I do. Sometimes I feel like a dog on two feet here behind you!"
"Finally. Five more minutes and you could have found me in the next tavern. By the way, I know a nice barmaid there!"
You need some protection? You came to just the right person.
"I knew that you wouldn't last long out there without me. You get lonesome, don't you?"
"Come on! Let's make some gold. Uh, I mean do some good!"
"All right, then I'll go this way in the meantime. I'll be back in two hours."
"Yeah, this place brings back old memories. I used to know a lady here. Ha! A lady. Once..."
Say?! Why have I never seen you with a girl?!
"Are you sure you want to go on your own? I mean... you are a... and I am a...? Nevermind, you are a strong and well-skilled woman. But if you get into problems you just scream and I'm right there."
"Yes, ma'am? No, ma'am! Whatever, ma'am."
"Nothing. But hey, nice legs."
"All right, I still have something to do anyway. There used to be a pub somewhere near here!"
"The attic room is empty, at the very top."
Nobody wants to sleep near Sinead.
We all know Sinead is a vampire.
"She keeps clear of us, though. Only feeds on her, er, customers."
"Brawler is in some kind of trouble with the guard. I wouldn't ask, unless you want to get friendly with that big mace of his."
Yuri and Penn are our Skooma addicts.
Don't see them at the kitchen table much.
Excellent work! I hope our customers are paying well.
"I'll send out a notice to all the branch managers, let them know that you can deliver between branches now."
"If you do enough inter-city packages, I should have another task for you. Come back and see me when you've delivered them."
Good work. You are very efficient. I have another task for you.
"Recently I've been getting requests from innkeepers around the countryside, they are in need of supplies."
I've added a new delivery board on the shelf opposite to the main board.. Good luck!
Talk to me again after you've delivered some packages.
"Good work. Something has come up. Something very important. You are an outstanding courier, you know that?"
I need as many loyal people as I can find in this business. I want you to take this package and deliver it to the Anvil Branch.
Lavasir should be out of the office when you get there. Just set the package on the board.
Good work. The profits from the inn runs are outstanding. I hope you are enjoying your take.
I'm going to promote you to Special Deliveries courier. You'll have access to special deliveries from now on!
I have some special deliveries for you now.
"Good work. With these packages delivered, I can expect steady income."
I'm going to promote you to full-time courier. You'll have access to all deliveries from now on!
"Now that you're a full-time courier, I need you to get a package from the Morrowind border, to the Valenwood border."
"At the border of Morrowind, you'll find a Dunmer named Dedave. He'll give you the package."
"At the border of Valenwood, you'll find a Khajiit named J'Dar. Give the package to him."
Hmm... I think I might have a spy in my delivery system!
"Hm, I need to figure this out..."
"And while I do that, go to Bruma and Anvil. The messengers will have packages for me."
"Pick up the packages from Bruma and Anvil, and bring them here."
"We are on the Gilded Duckling, one of a number of vessels owned by my Duke."
"Duke Agrivaine. He and his wife - along with some guests - are here from Summerset Isle, visiting Cyrodiil's [QUOTE]finest[QUOTE] cities."
"Though if Bravil is truly one of the finest, I think this trip will be a short one."
The Gilded Duckling has no captain. The crew take their orders from my Duke.
"A friend of mine, Ferntail, used to live there. He was a big-shot in the Thieves Guild, smuggled a lot of stolen goods out of that place, and never got caught."
"His old Shadowscale connections caught up with him, however, so he put it up for sale, and fled north into the mountains."
"Last I heard, he was somewhere near Bruma."
This is the place for it. The best diving is in the deepest waters.
It's fairly wet in Leyawiin at the moment. Swamp water's risen. Are those boots waterproof?
"Hang on, that's not enough gold! You'll have to walk!"
"I'm sure I couldn't say, sir."
"I'm sure I couldn't say, madam."
"I am the Duke's head butler. When The Duke and Duchess decided to take this voyage from Shimerene on Summerset Isle,"
he chose myself and one of the maids to serve him and the Duchess. We also serve his guests on occasion.
"No, the Duke brought his favourite cook too. He's probably below deck right now, preparing the next meal."
"I may be an Imperial, but I have never visited Cyrodiil before. Summerset is my home, and no place looks like Bravil there."
"I don't like the Imperial City. Too dry, too crowded. It will cost 200 gold to sail there, takes about eighteen hours."
"Virani is renting one of our rooms upstairs. She's a member of the Archaeology Guild, perhaps she can help."
"Well, I don't believe anybody actually living in Chorrol would be able to help you."
"But there's a woman from the Archaeology Guild visiting the Twin Goblet Alehouse, so you could ask her."
"If you could explore the area beyond the gate, make sure it's safe..."
Then we'll know it's okay to send our expedition in to see what we can find!
What do you say? I can provide you with a magic scroll to get past the Silver Gate.
"Since you've found the gate, you're clearly the adventurous type. If you could explore the area beyond the gate, make sure it's safe..."
Then we'll know it's okay to send our expedition in to see what we can find!
What do you say? I can provide you with a magic scroll to get past the Silver Gate.
Have you changed your mind? I still have the magic scroll here to get past the Silver Gate.
Oh good! I just knew when we started talking about the Silver Gate that you would be interested in helping!
"Here's the magic scroll. When you're fairly close to the gate, simply cast the spell and you should be able to see the switch to unlock it."
The Guild hid the switch to protect careless adventurers from danger. I'm sure you're not careless though!
"Take this key as well. There's a shortcut to get down to the Silver Gate, through the old Chorrol Cistern."
The entrance is just south and slightly east of Chorrol's southern entrance.
"Such a shame. Well if you change your mind, please do come see me again. In the meantime, perhaps you could leave me to my studies?"
Destination?
That's 200 gold. The trip should take about eighteen hours.
Members of the Imperial Legion can sail from the Imperial City for free.

Don't waste the Legion's time. Do you know how busy it gets down here at the Waterfront?!
Move along then. Next!
...You don't have enough money.
Get out of my sight!
"Carry on, then legionary."
Move along then. Next!
...You don't have enough money.
Get out of my sight!
"Carry on, then legionary."
"Please sir, I really couldn't say!"
"Please miss, I really couldn't say!"
"I... I don't know anything! If you please, the Duke will fire me if I don't get back to work now."
"Quite sure sir. Now I must be returning to my duties, please excuse me."
"Quite sure madam. Now I must be returning to my duties, please excuse me."
"The Duke is the captain. He doesn't like having a proper captain on board giving the orders, so he takes charge himself when on voyages."
He's very good at it!
The Duke is named Agrivaine. I spend most of my time attending to Duchess Giselle though. She is so nice!
Oh I'm just the maid! I keep the mid-deck and dining-deck clean and tidy. Mostly I stay close to Duchess Giselle in case she needs me.
"Sometimes I do something for Lady Trivelda, but I try to avoid her."
What? No!! I never said that! Please don't suggest such a thing! I love all the Duke's guests!
"This ship? It belongs to the Duke. He has two or three ships, this one is called the Guild of Ducklings."
Or something like that.
"Yes! Well, that's where we came from at the start of this voyage. The Duke and Duchess are from Shimerene, and I work for them."
"But I was born in Kvatch. My parents moved to a village not far from Shimerene on Summerset Isle when I was five, and I've lived there ever since."
"Oh, how sad. But I barely remember the city, and have no family living there now."
I suppose I am fortunate that my parents left fifteen years ago.
Then follow me!
You won't go on a journey like this without the coins!
"Ah, I see, you live in a dream world."
"Now, I live in the real world. A world of blood, mud, dirt and rust."
"And only the tiny, shiny glance of gold makes this little girl here happy..."
"I suggest you get a job, while I keep working mine."
Farewell.
Then follow me!
Why would anyone want to go to Bravil? Well it's your money.
"You don't have 30 gold do you? What are you, a beggar? Stop wasting my time!"
"She has only been here a couple of weeks, but we often have Archaeology Guildmembers staying with us."
"Go on upstairs if you want to talk with her, these bookworms need the occasional distraction."
"Yes, she's still staying here."
"Very well, courier. I offered you a chance. You could have been very rich!"
[Goldhorn attempts to use his artifact again... but it makes a whining noise and fails to work]

"Oh never mind, I need a break from studying anyway. Hey, you look the adventurous type..."
"I am a member of the Archaeology Guild, and there is a cavern beneath Chorrol which the Guild wishes to explore, beyond a Silver Gate."
The Guild plans to send an expedition down to investigate what might be beyond the gate. It should be quite exciting!
"But... well, when exploring ancient chambers and caverns untouched by civilized people for centuries, there are many possible risks."
So the expedition is on hold for now. Perhaps you could help?
"The house outside the city? The previous owner left in a hurry, and asked me to sell it for him."
"It's a bit run-down, even by standards here, but perfectly livable. Are you interested?"
The house is still for sale if you want it.
Let me know how you're settling in.
"Excellent. I'm selling it for 6,000 gold."
"Excellent. I'm selling it for 10,000 gold."
"Excellent. I'm selling it for 15,000 gold."
"Excellent. I'm selling it for 20,000 gold."
"Excellent. I'm selling it for 30,000 gold."
"Excellent. I'm selling it for 1,500 gold."
Oh well. Come back if you reconsider.

Oh well.
My offer is still 100 Gold for the ewe.
I have a couple ewes. Perhaps you'd be interested in buying one?
"All my goods are spoken for, this week."
"Yes, they're a little thin about the flanks, you needn't point it out to me."
"If you want healthier livestock, go to the Western towns and countryside, though I'm guessing you'll find the price of a fat and happy sheep less to your liking."
"I'll give you one of mine for 100 Gold. An excellent deal, since you were thoughtful enough to mention their shortcomings."
"Excellent. I'll have the stablehand bring her to your house, here in the Waterfront."
A pleasure doing business with you.
You don't seem to have 100 Gold. What a pity.
Your loss. See how you like paying 500 gold in Chorrol.
"Any official document, I can create or duplicate."
"The Guard Captain has tried to shut me down seven times, but the evidence has a way of... disappearing at the last minute."
"Oh, I never leave the ship. Docks always stink of fish and filthy sailors. Uuurgh."
"Shhh! Not now! Can't you see he's nearby, he might overhear!"
"Yes, tell me what you have discovered!"
"You... oh good grief, I have an imbecile working for me!"
Kildred! Lord Kildred! Now go and do something useful!
I see. Well hurry it up will you? I am impatient to know.
"I stay out of the town, actually. The Shadowscale assassins would find me, if I had a residence."
"It's wretched up here, though - I have frost under every scale."
I wonder what my old friend Marsh is doing now.
"My friend Marsh. He dives for pearls out on a tiny island, north-east of Bravil."
Some of those pearls he finds are like nothing else.
"If I could have a Luminescent Pearl, then being stuck up here would feel less wretched."
"If you happen to come across one, then bring it to me, and I'll give you something in return."
"Talk to Marsh, he'll know where to look."
"A Luminescent Pearl! My spirits are uplifted, the frost seems to bite less, as I hold it."
"Here is your reward. The key opens a chest in an empty crate, just behind my old house. My favorite ring is inside, but I won't need it up here. It's yours, now, and may it prove helpful."
"So Ferntail wants a luminescent pearl. Those only grow in shiny clams, which are in the deepest waters, around this island."
"They might be difficult to get to, but I'd put some effort into it. Ferntail can be quite generous when he's feeling pleased."
I'm glad the old man is surviving up there.

Please find my book. You'll receive a nice reward!
"Oh, you found my diary! Here is your reward!"
You'd better not have read it.
I don't know. Some fellow we left behind in Shimerene!
"It's a city on Summerset Isle, where we Altmer reside. It's a magical place!"
"My wife is from Shimerene, as is Agrivaine. I come from Firsthold myself."
As a special service for our customers we offer a secure deposit chest in our vault for a one time fee of 200 gold only. Are you interested?
"Without a bank chest key, you'll need to see Cornelius in his office upstairs."
"You wish to access your deposit chest in the vault? Certainly, Dro'Hajat will unlock the gate for you now."
I think you are a bit short on gold.
"Here is your key, don't lose it. You'll find your chest downstairs in the vault. It's the one on the small table."
As you wish. What else can I do for you?
"Yes, don't you agree?"
"Oh piffle! Even if it does, rain is wonderfully refreshing. I thought I'd leave the ship for a bit!"
"Ah, breathe that fresh air! Perfect for wandering around. I thought I'd leave the ship for a bit!"
The Gilded Duckling! It's in the Bravil Docks. My wife and I were invited to travel with Duke Agrivaine and visit a few different ports.

Go bother someone else.
Yes! This library was built by the Empire for its citizens.
"Ho ho, you've got me there! But I didn't mean [QUOTE]day[QUOTE] in the literal sense. I've just been for a nice walk, thought I'd get off the ship for a bit."
You! Yes you in front of the Alehouse! You have some serious explaining to do!
"Oh does it not normally snow around here? I suppose we are a little far south. Still, it's a lovely day in spite of the snow."
"I thought I'd leave the ship for a bit, take a walk. Perhaps, throw a snowball or two!!!"
"Why do you ask? This is my ship, I own it. I left Captain Aldaril back on Summerset Isle. Are you some sort of Port Authority?"
"Look I signed the forms allowing me to dock here, go see the Harbour Master and stop bothering me!"
I am a Duke you know.
"Oh, I say! You've been speaking with Sorink, haven't you? He's lying I tell you, Count Marius Caro sorted it all out, the fine was a mistake."
"Oh, you're not? Sorry about that, I had a bit of hassle in Leyawiin."
"Some chap called Sorink took my signature, then went and bally well lost the paperwork. Tried to fine me for having my boat in the harbour!"
"I had to go start a gods-awful row with Count Marius Caro to sort it all out. Wouldn't want to go through that again, what!"
"Yes I am, as a matter of fact. From Summerset Isle. Shimerene, to be exact."
"Yes, good friend of mine from back at school, we boarded together in the Imperial City, you know. We used to call him Mari Cari."
"He's the Count of Leyawiin now, of course."
"Which one, I have several? Of course, you're probably asking about this one we're on right now."
"This is The Gilded Duckling, my secondary luxury [QUOTE]yacht[QUOTE], for when I want to go abroad in comfort."
"Well, I mean, of course! This is an Imperial vessel by design. No match for a good Altmeri vessel."
"My best ship, I lent to my cousin Aldarilar, a couple months ago. 'Bout time he brought it back again, you know."
"Oh not now, I'm not in the mood to reminisce."
Don't try to deny it! He's the nasty fellow in charge of the Leyawiin Port Authority. Thought he was going to set his goons on me!
He's the nasty fellow in charge of the Leyawiin Port Authority. Thought he was going to set his goons on me!
"Why, I don't know. Goes for walks, I suppose. Why don't you ask his wife? Or just ask Kildred himself! I barely know the fellow."
"Well, it's hardly a desirable locale, is it? Most of the town's rotting away. The castle and its gardens are jolly good though, very well maintained."
"Gosh, well! I barely saw the damn place, did I? Too much hassle from the Port Authority."
And it was jolly hard navigating this ship into the Lower Niben. The Count really needs to deepen and widen the waterway there.
"A fine woman. She was a minx when we were children, always getting us into trouble! Oh, we grew up together in Shimerene, you know?"
You have to open an account at the Bank of Cyrodiil in the Imperial City first.
"Yes, Gold Horse Couriers have an arrangement with the Bank of Cyrodiil, I can give you access to your account."
The fee is 2% for each transaction.
"Remember, the fee is 2% for each transaction."
"Yes, Gold Horse Couriers have an arrangement with the Bank of Cyrodiil."
But only the other branches can give you access to your account...
"Here in the Imperial City, you should head to the Bank itself, in the Market District."
"Yes, Gold Horse Couriers have an arrangement with the Bank of Cyrodiil."
"But here in Leyawiin, you should head to the Bank itself, by the West Gate."
"It belongs to my loving husband, Agrivaine. The Gilded Duckling isn't his favourite ship, but I think it's perfectly comfortable. Isn't it nice?"
"Agrivaine? He is a Duke, which makes me a Duchess. Isn't that nice? We live in Shimerene on Summerset Isle."
"He isn't with us, we left him behind in Shimerene. Agrivaine likes to play captain when we take these trips. Isn't that nice?"
"Oh, Shimerene is a very nice town, with a wide harbour. Thanks to the smaller of the two Summerset Isles, the harbour water is always calm."
"I wasn't born in Shimerene however. I was born in Alinor, a very nice town on the west coast of Summerset Isle. The harbour isn't so grand though."
"Of course, the harbour here is very nice too. Though it's called a dock rather than a harbour by the locals. Yes, Bravil Docks are very nice."
"We recently came from Leyawiin. They have a harbour too, and it's very nice. The Port Authority was not so nice."
"Oh, well yes. Yes I suppose I have! Isn't that nice?"
"It's... um. It's a little grotty, isn't it? Still, I'm sure the people who live here must think it is very nice, otherwise they'd leave!"
Leyawiin was much nicer.
We didn't get to see much of Leyawiin city however. I'm afraid my husband had a bit of an upset with one of their authority figures.
"Still, we're here now rather than there, which is nice, so my husband can enjoy himself. Isn't that..."
"Oh! Hee hee. Do you know, I was just about to say that! However did you guess? You're very clever. Isn't that nice?"
"Did Lady Trivelda really say that? Oh, isn't that nice of her?"
"She isn't very free with giving compliments, I think she reserves them for special moments. Isn't that nice?"
"Well, she can be a little curt at times, but I'm sure I deserve it. She grew up with my husband in Shimerene, isn't that nice?"
"She and her husband, Lord Kildred, are our guests here on this ship. Isn't that nice?"
"Well, she can be a little curt at times, but I'm sure I deserve it. She grew up with my husband in Shimerene, isn't that nice?"
"She and her husband, Lord Kildred, are our guests here on this ship. Isn't that nice?"
"I believe he goes for walks along the docks, and sometimes a short way along the Green Road. He even likes to walk when it's raining!"
Isn't that nice!
Get in my way and you'll wish you'd never been born! Brat! Just like your little girl!
"Oh! Couldn't the little paladin save the princess? What a shame! Well, how do you like that!"
"Ha, ha, ha! You little parasite, I'll crush you as an insect deserves."
How much do you want to pay in?
How much do you want to withdraw?
Let me have a look into my account book.
"Doesn't this apron give it away? I'm a cook! I work on The Gilded Duckling, I prepare all the meals for the Duke and his guests."
It's a ship. It floats. What more is there to know?
"Yes, it's in the Bravil Docks now. I'm buying fresh supplies for the kitchen."
Crab soup.
"Yeah. You'd be amazed just how little edible meat there is in them. I mean, for their size, you'd think there'd be much more to eat in that shell!"
Can't remember.
"Oh wait, Aldaril, I think. He didn't come with us on this voyage though."
"Duke Agrivaine is a fine man. He could've picked any of the other four cooks on his staff to come with him on this voyage, but he picked me. A fine man!"
His wife is [QUOTE]nice[QUOTE]. Heh heh.
"She can be a bit much at times, but she's always very positive. Not like that Lady Trivelda woman."
"He brought some Lord and Lady with him this time. The Lord is nice enough, though he spends a lot of meals on the mainland."
But the Lady... she's a handful. Dunno how he puts up with her.
Don't like her. I won't have her in my kitchen! Not that she'd deem it worthy of her presence anyway.
"She complains about most of my meals. Bah, let's not talk about her."
He goes for walks. Especially at meal times. I'd be insulted if he weren't so nice when he IS here for the meals.
"I've seen him near the Bravil Barrel Brewery, and up on the Green Road a few times."
Perhaps next time.
I am a member of the Imperial Legion. Presently my duties are to remain on this ship until it returns to Topal Bay.
"As we pass Leyawiin on its return journey to Summerset Isle, I will be disembarking. But until then, I am to guard this ship from troublemakers."
"I'm sorry, I can't talk now, I'm on duty."
"This is The Gilded Duckling, and you shouldn't really be on-board."
"I believe there is no captain, sir."
"I believe there is no captain, madam."
What? Why would you ask that?
"Oh, of course the guar pen outside. They're nothing to do with me, I can tell you!"
"Smelly animals, I'm sure they're spoiling business. I'm also certain that Erwyn Drelas did NOT get permission from Count Indarys."
"We don't sell guar here! You'll have to visit Vvardenfell Imports, it's just beyond the guar pen."
"I wrote a letter of complaint to Count Andel Indarys about those dirty animals being allowed within the city walls, and I'm awaiting his response!"

Look. You recovered the Blade of Namira. And you are probably the only mortal person in this world who still knows about Ruun.
And what you saw were just words. Do you know what happened to the kingdom after King Ardan threw his people at the feet of the Dragonborn?
What is written in the scriptures about the [QUOTE]Dark Ages[QUOTE] does not even cover half of what swept across the country one hundred years earlier.
The 'Bloody Age'.
"May it be forgotten for all time! Daedra cults formed, blending arcane power with human cruelty!"
Raged in the ruins of Ruun like ravens over a field of blood after battle freshly fought. Scrambled over the carrion of King Ardan's legacy!
Have you ever heard about the cult of Mephalists?
"Then you know about their madness. And how they were destroyed too. But this, is a lie!"
I knew it when I saw you from the very first moment. Now listen to me carefully!
"I managed to thwart any search for the Bloodscript. But that fool, Auril, a master of the lore of the Ancients..."
Used knowledge behind my back that I gave him. He betrayed me and everything you see and call life.
"Stole away, breathing new life into oblivion."
"In such times it was easy to find followers. And as soon as I could track him down, I had hundreds of them blocking my path."
"But I tell you: the cult of the Mephalists lives again. They dwell like worms in the darkness, waiting to reach for the impossible again!"
And they are here already!
"Think about it. I'll wait here. But believe me, my request to you is urgent! For the Bloodscript will soon be found."
"When you see a person, do you only judge them by their appearance?"
Beneath these neglected walls lies a bloodfield of the gods.
Auril hung around here for a long time. But then his corpse was found completely naked in the swamps.
Whoever did this good work cannot be measured in gold.
"But I know him, and I know he wouldn't have been foolish enough to leave a message for his brood."
Hold the Bloodscript for me. And I'll grant you a wish you never dared to dream of. Tell me your price!
What you desire you will receive. Find Auril's Legacy and bring the book to me. It must be destroyed in the Halls of Ln.
"It took me some years to even find the place, and its ritual chamber has not suffered through the ages, its arcane force is still powerful."
"It will serve us well, my friend. And now, serve me."

"Yes, what of it?"
"They're smelly, crowded, and rotting. I love it! This is just what a dock should be like."
A bit lacking in danger mind you. A real dock should have cut-throats threatening people for their money!
"It's a living, just like any other. But you won't find such in the docks and harbours of Cyrodiil's mainland."
There's still a large enough Imperial guard presence to prevent it. You have to go to one of the seedier island ports for that.
Yes! There are many islands off the coast of Tamriel. Plenty of places for pirates and such. Some more dangerous than others.
"Most of them! Hah! Even I stay clear of The Gap, there's ONLY pirates living there."
"You don't want to know, and you should hope you never find yourself there."
Anything else?
Yes?
Very well!
Very well!
Vark is freezing my tab until I can pay him.
"I don't have much to sell, except perhaps... I have this old house down the road. Bit of a slum, but maybe..."
"Maybe you'd like to buy it? I'll give it to you for only 200 Gold, what do you say?"
"My tab is still frozen. Do you want my shack, now?"
Sad? Never again.
"Why would I need a shack, I spend all my time here anyway."
"Vark never closes shop, bless his heart!"
You're a life-saver.
"This'll open the door for you. It's just down the road, next to the old burnt tree."
"Oh, you don't seem to have 200 Gold..."
Vark will never reopen my tab...
Oh bother.
"Well, let me know if you change your mind."
That's the one daddy! Over there coming out of the Alehouse!
"I'll take care of this. Go home, Elaine."
"Erm, I think I might have said hello to him once or twice..."
"Well I can hardly deny it, seeing as he's right here!"
"What is it to you, anyway?"
My old house was just west of Marsh's island. I put it up for sale when I left.
"Good old shack, it will serve its new inhabitants well."
"I see. Well, now you know the truth, will you tell Lady Trivelda that her husband is sleeping with me?"
How rude! Get out now!
"Damn you! Be off with you then. Kildred, wake up..."
Damn y... Oh! Really? I hope you are being truthful when you say this.
Please leave now.
"Oh-hoh, so it's blackmail is it? You'd better speak with Lord Kildred then, he's the rich one. Kildred, wake up..."
He comes in here on occasion. Haven't seen him recently though.
He comes in here on occasion. Haven't seen him recently though.
"Oh, wait, isn't that him over there?"
"Why are you asking? You're not going to be causing trouble in my inn, are you?"
"Ug, me tough!"
"Ug, me tough!"
"Ug, me tough!"
"Me tough, ug, you tough?"
"Ug, thee tough!"
"Ug, me tough!"
"Then get out now, before I call the guards."
"Good. Well, Lord Kildred often visits one of my patrons on the 2nd floor, he may just be up there now."
I'm watching you.
"He's that tall Altmer isn't he? Oh yes, they're ALL tall, silly me!"
"Well, he's here most every other day. Visits one of our guests quite often, he does. I hear his wife is a right old trout!"
"Oh. Oh, well that is good news. You may leave now and return to your normal duties."
"You are so rude! Is my thanks not enough? Begone, beggar!"
And try to find more suitable attire in the future.
Very good indeed! Now I can drink myself clean into oblivion!
Well then get out of my face land lover! Go and fetch me a brew!
"Yes, it's not doing me much good as I have been living at the Tavern. How 'bout you take her off my hands for say... 20,000 gold?"
"Yes you, you bastard! You'll pay for what you did to my daughter Elaine!"
"Yes you, you bastard! You'll pay for what your brother did to my daughter Elaine."
You saw her just then! She's with child because of you! And now you're going to marry her and provide for her and the unborn child.
"Don't try to lie your way out of this! Elaine just identified you. If you don't marry her, I'll call the guards and have them arrest you..."
I'll think of a crime which will have you executed within a week!
"Hah! You continue to lie, then do you? Trying to find an excuse not to take responsibility for your actions? Very well, I'm a fair man."
"I'll give you a chance, but eventually you'll have to admit the truth, and marry Elaine."
"Hah! You continue to lie, then do you? Trying to find an excuse not to take responsibility for your brother's actions? Very well, I'm a fair man."
"I'll give you a chance, but eventually you'll have to admit the truth, and provide regular payments for Elaine throughout the child's life."
"Beneath Chorrol? Hmm, I don't recall ever hearing about such a thing before. Don't you go unleashing any monsters onto the streets of Chorrol!"
"Why are you nosing around beneath Chorrol? I heard there's a member of the Archaeology Guild staying in the city, but I'm not sure where."
"I don't like the sound of this, you'll just stir up trouble for the guards to have to deal with. Leave it alone."
"Sounds like fantasy to me, but there's a member of the Archaeology Guild staying at the Twin Goblet Alehouse, perhaps she can help."
Shhhh! Not here! Meet me at the warehouse around 2 in the morning. We can talk business there.
"Skooma? Yes indeed, I have what you need."
"I am in charge of ensuring that the Imperial City's water supply is constant and clean, but I have encountered a few problems lately..."
Perhaps you could help me...
I knew it! I knew it!
You have done as I asked. Thank you. Now begone!
"Yes, we've got a nasty problem there. I can pay you fifty gold for each rat you kill."
"Beneath the Waterfront Tunnel is a small network of naturally-formed caverns. We don't use them for anything, but there have been reports lately..."
Well apparently some rather vicious rats have been breeding down there. Occasionally they come up out of the undercaverns!
Really? Fantastic! You can enter the undercaverns through the grate in the Tunnel near the Waterfront gates.
"You're looking for the rats with darker fur than you'd normally see around here. We're worried that they might be plague-carriers, so be careful!"
Huh. You and all the rest. Guess I shouldn't have mentioned how vicious they are!
"Don't try to lie your way out of this! Elaine just identified you as his sister. If you don't commit to providing for her and the child, I'll call the guards and have them arrest you..."
I'll think of a crime which will have you executed within a week!
"Don't try to lie your way out of this! Elaine just identified you as his sister. If you don't commit to providing for her and the child, I'll call the guards and have them arrest you..."

I'll think of a crime which will have you executed within a week!
"For your... oh, to keep quiet? I can give you 2,000 gold! Only, I don't have it on me just now..."
"Uh, she did?"
Please don't tell her! Please!
Oh? Well where's the proof? I'm not paying you without evidence that you've actually killed any rats!
Well don't just give them to me! I might catch something!
"Come with me to the furnace, you can throw them in there."
Ah you've gotten quite a few of them! You have certainly earned your keep this day.
Not a bad load! Here's your pay.
You didn't get very many. That better have been all of them.
"I'm sorry, I was afraid! I daren't tell my father the truth. Please, can't you help?"
"Well, perhaps you could find the man... the man who... well, who caused... this."
"Execution? Yes, I suppose my father could find a way to have the guards execute you, he'd be able to persuade them of a serious enough crime."
It has been around six months since I last saw him... as my situation shows. He went to speak with a woman wearing a red robe staying at the Twin Goblet Alehouse.
"That's why we were there just now, my father was going to see if this woman in the red robe was still there. When I saw you coming out, I just spoke without thinking!"
"Well? Have you found your [QUOTE]evidence[QUOTE] yet, or are you ready to admit the truth?"
"If my husband Lucien had his way, you'd already be married and Elaine would be living with you. But I don't like the look of you, I don't think Elaine would be safe with you."
"If my husband Lucien had his way, your brother would already be married and Elaine would be living with him. But since he isn't here, you must be responsible for his actions."
"It seems I was wrong about you. You are a good person, and you will always be welcome to visit us."
"No, I only arrived here about a week ago. Why do you ask?"
I see. How melodramatic! I used to read books with such stories when I was young.
"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm being insensitive. Well as I said, I only arrived about a week ago. I think Sova may have visited Chorrol for a time five or six months ago."
"You already told me all of this, there's no need to repeat yourself!"
"She is a fellow guildmember. You should be able to find her at the Archaeology Guild's headquarters, south of the Imperial City, near Pell's Gate."
She is a fellow guildmember. Perhaps she employed this adventurer Elaine became [QUOTE]acquainted[QUOTE] with to try to explore beyond that silver gate we spoke of?
She is a fellow guildmember. Perhaps she employed this adventurer Elaine became [QUOTE]acquainted[QUOTE] with to try to explore this cavern?
"Yes, how did you know that? I was staying at the Twin Goblet Alehouse. Guildmembers often rent a room there when visiting Chorrol."
I already told you that I was.
"What a silly girl, getting herself pregnant. And stupid to just randomly accuse the first stranger she sees!"
"I remember speaking with the man she told you of, he was an adventurer, like yourself. He agreed to explore some unusual Ayleid ruins beyond a silver gate beneath Chorrol, to check if they were safe for the Archaeology Guild to send in an expedition."
"When he didn't return, I could only assume the worst, that the caves aren't safe, so the guild expedition was put on hold. Though I suppose it's possible he may still be alive down there."
"The Guild had the door locked, and we hid the switch to prevent any foolhardy explorers from entering."
"Yes, alright. As long as you're sure these ghosts aren't a threat."
"Yes, I'm coming."
"It's a good thing the gas trap has run out of gas, else we might have been killed ourselves!"
"Alright, I have now seen these two dead adventurers. I can tell Lucien Breucombe that you speak the truth when you return to him. I will meet you there."
"So here we are. You go ahead and speak with Lucien, I'll confirm that what you say is true."
Let's see... oh! This all reminds me of the book [QUOTE]From Rags to Riches... to Pauper's Grave[QUOTE] by Isabeau Richlau. I loved her books when I was young.
"The heroine falls for a handsome young man, who disappears after a swift romance. She goes searching for him, following a trail of his adventures as he gains a powerful position working for a royal family."
"But eventually she finds a note much like this one written to her but never sent. She returns home heartbroken, and never learns that he didn't send the note because he changed his mind, and was heading back to her village to tell her..."
"Needless to say, he is attacked by highwaymen on the road and left for dead in a ditch, and so ends the book. I think there might be a sequel, but I never found a copy."
"I... see. It would seem that I owe you an apology then. I'm sorry, I never imagined that Elaine would falsely accuse anybody."
"But now, if he's dead, Elaine will have to raise the child on her own. It will be difficult, but we have some money, I think we can afford it."
"Please, let Elaine know your findings, she's upstairs."
"Wha.. really?! Even after everything I put you through? Incredible. Yes thank you, I will gladly accept your offer, this should really help."
"Wha.. really?! Even after everything I put you through? Incredible. Yes thank you, I will gladly accept your offer, this will ensure the child has a comfortable life."
He'd written to Elaine? Perhaps you should let her have it as a memory of their time together.
"Thank you, perhaps it will cheer her up a little."
Oh? May I?
"Yes, I see. Thank you, I shall get rid of this, Elaine should never have a chance to see what this despicable man was really like."
"Oh dear, he promised me he'd return as soon as he could. At least now I know what happened, that he was prevented from returning, it was not through choice."
"Written to me? Oh, let me read it..."
"But this... this is... oh the bastard! I hate him, I HATE him!!!! I'm glad he's dead! He deserves worse... go away, please, leave me be..."
"Well thank you for helping me. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a bit."
"Yes, use the furnace! It's right at your feet."
Don't you think so?
"Yes, I suppose you're right."
Really? I was thinking of going for a walk. And this time I mean [QUOTE]a walk[QUOTE].
How right you are! I should be in bed.
"So it is. Oh well, it's only water. I think I'll go for a walk. And this time, I really mean [QUOTE]a walk[QUOTE]."
"Oh? Maybe I shouldn't be outside then, it'll be getting cold."
"They left me here! After my wife found out about Saxa and myself, she persuaded Agrivaine to return home to Summerset Isle."
"She never did have much trouble getting her own way with Agrivaine, so I suppose I shouldn't be so surprised."
"Yes. Yes, I think I will. She is much easier to get along with than my wife, and it wouldn't be easy to return home now anyway, I have no money!"
"He needs me. His wife was cruel and unpleasant, he wouldn't be able to go on without me!"
"Now that she is out of his life, he can be happy."
"Go and find my husband. But don't let him know, I want you to find out where he keeps going most evenings."
Come back when you know what he's been getting up to.
Excellent. Don't dally.
Oh! You don't know his name? Lord Kildred.
Pay you?! I only mentioned it because I thought I could trust you!
Oh! And I thought we had become good friends.
Be off with you then.
Oh! How rude. And I thought we had become friends.
"Well then, speak to me again when you are not [QUOTE]too busy[QUOTE]."
"Ah, so, you're no longer [QUOTE]too busy[QUOTE] to help a friend then?"
Not now! See me later. When he isn't around.
Really? How wonderful! Thank you so much!
"Please, let us have some privacy now."
So you're going to tell her?
Oh dear oh dear oh dear...
"Tomorrow evening perhaps? Yes, yes I think I can have it for you tomorrow evening. I'll send a messenger to confirm when I have the money."
"Now, please give us some privacy."

Ridiculous!
"No, sire. Every little string will now twist into a path of fate you will walk along. I wish to equalise the balance of powers, sire. And you have the proper weight."

"Oh, sire, you are as wise as an innocent mouse that gnaws its last meal under the owl's tree!"
"One is dead, sire, only when the name has been erased from the memory of the living!"
"Look at the creatures of the world, sire, in their daily pursuits of earning and diversion."

"Walking dead flesh. They do not strive for great deeds, except maybe in their imagination."
"But Ardan, sire, has been a king. A ruler equal to the gods, sire, who shifted the balance of power between the worlds!"
And you will be his heir and the executioner of his name!
"Aye, sire. I want you to disturb Ardan's rest. Break the curse of his grave and let him go down to the gods he betrayed in life!"
"Time, sire. I have far more than you. And destiny, sire, is already written. Inevitable. You are already walking on the right path!"
"Is that it, sire? Easier than treading a worm's path or turning stupidity into bravery?"
"Brave, sire, to approach the Trial of Ardan in this way. But you are not the first hero, sire, whose mouth was swifter than his mind."
"Show me your bravery, sire, and that the grey flesh in your head is good for more than survival."
And your reward will be greater than you ever dreamed!
"Take this, my hero! And prove my confidence! Put the mosaic together and I'll give you this clue:"
"Keep the Bloodscript with you, sire! All day. Every day. And it will let you see, sire. See!"
Hundreds of heroes found their final resting place in Ardan's tomb.
I'm sorry sire. But the peasants refuse to pay. They have risen up against you and are demanding democracy.
"It's your birthday, sire."
"It's getting better, sire."
"Ahh, sire. It's been a very rough week."
"Ahh, sire. It's been a very rough week."
"Well, we could invest it. Maybe it will make a profit?"
"Well, this was an average week."
"Morndas, sire. Morndas is tax collection day."
"Sire, why do you insult me? Morndas is the day for tax money. You know it, and I know it. So why do you test me?"
"Sire, I will make you an offer. You allow me to continue working until Morndas and I'll make sure we have more tax money..."
"Yes, yes, sire. And if it were Morndas, I would be able to give you the collected gold."
"Sire? My tool of total revenge, it returns to me!"
"And makes a gloomy face, although it restored the balance of powers. Never again will a word be spoken about what happened."
"Ruun is forgotten and you take over Ardan's legacy. Don't be as stupid as your predecessor, sire, and now take what's yours. I'm staying here."
Here in Bravil.
"Ah, you noticed that I don't have the complete set. Yes, sadly I have only the first three books."
"I used to have all six books, but I leant the final three books to Lys Koch, and he never returned them."
"Here's a thought, perhaps you might be able to ask him to return my books?"
"If you've changed your mind, I'd still appreciate your help recovering the books from Lys Koch."
"You have all three books! Thank you so much, I had feared I would never see these again."
"Here, take this book as a reward. It's not as rare, but it's still fairly valuable, and it's a good read too."
"Now I'll put these books upstairs, I should make some copies so that more people can enjoy the complete series of The Attempted Resurgence of the Illusionist."
I hope you'll manage to find those books!
"How wonderful! Lys Koch has a room in the Converted Checkpoint Apartments, near the Temple District entrance to the Waterfront Tunnel."
"He often visits the Arcane University as well, so if he isn't in his room, you could look there."
"Such a shame. I simply don't have the time to track him down myself. If you change your mind, come see me."
"Yes indeed, Auriel did lend me some books. It was quite some time ago however, I don't really recall where the books are right now."
"One of them is in my room, you may take it back to Auriel. Here is my key."
"Now, I am too busy to concern myself with such things, if you want to look for the other two books, speak with my apprentice, Orvil."
Don't bother me again about these books. I already told you to speak with Orvil.
You're not the one I've been waiting for! Are you just a henchman of this nefarious creature that hides in the guise of a Dunmer?
The outrage of this desecration of the grave is an unforgivable mistake.
"Your Lord Ma Syd Jun, made a good choice in you for his final act of vengeance. Oblivion. What are kings without names. Hm?"
"Destroying my spirit will not undo my deeds, warrior. The human heart beats to the sound of the Nine."
"And if you salvage a hundred blades from my temple and claim my heritage under this dragon banner, the old days will be over."
"Ruun. Is dead. And your master will never forget, even if your flesh is good only for worms, that it was I who converted Ruun."
So let's finish it! Let's fight over the greatest legacy of life. The eternity of a name! Let's get this over with!
"Hmm, yes I remember those books. Lys Koch carried them everywhere for a while - or rather, I carried them everywhere for Lys Koch for a while."
We even took them with us when we travelled across Cyrodiil. It was only when we arrived back in the Imperial City that I realised I had lost two.
"Let me see now... as I recall, we visited Kassandra in Bruma, and we stayed with Hanse in Leyawiin. Perhaps I left the books in one of those places?"
"Kassandra in Bruma, and Hanse in Leyawiin. Go speak with them, perhaps one has the missing books."
"The illusion book, yes! Lys Koch left it here after he visited. Someone in the Mages Guild had told him I was a powerful magic-caster."
"But they were mistaken, I have no magic abilities at all. I kept the book in hopes that he might return for it."
"You can take it with you, it rests above the fireplace."
Didn't you take the book already? Look above the fireplace!
"I remember when Lys Koch last came to visit. He is a good friend of mine, and often makes use of my library. Sometimes he even brings me new books!"
"I do recall him leaving a book behind. In fact, I thought it was one of his gifts, such a pity I cannot keep it."
"Oh well, the book should be returned to its rightful owner. Look in my library, you'll find the book on one of the shelves."
"Upstairs, in my library. It's there somewhere, I'm quite sure."
As you wish.
"You're giving up? What a shame, I was so hopeful that you could be relied upon to bring my books back."
"Very well, forget I asked for your help."
"Good, I am relieved to hear that!"
His name is Cathun. It means 'brawl' in the older tongue. He has strengths you should not underestimate.
"Ah that guy, he's a regular, never mind him. And best ignore the trolls with him as well."
"Melly! Open up, Melly!"
Forget it Torro. You can bang on that door all night if you want. There is no way in Oblivion I'm letting you in!
"I can't believe you're doing this to me, Melly. After everything we've been through. Surely that means something to you!"
Ha! It meant plenty! Plenty of lost pay because nobody wants to flirt with a barmaid whose face is all purple and swollen up with bruises.
"I know you're angry, my darling. And I forgive you, even though you haven't even asked me to!"
"There's a difference between being mad at a lover who's generally not so bad, and finding out that you've been sweet-talked by a scamp-eating dreugh-face who slips out once in a while from his mistresses from all over Cyrodiil!"
"That hurt, Melly. It's okay if you pretend to be mad, but you don't have to kick me between the legs too!"
Do yourself a favor Torro and get some help. Yes! From Grindion or Hernantier!
I could swear I heard somebody in there with you just now.
"Somebody? Torro, it's a regular Bretonic love-festival in here! I... I've got all the Imperial City arena fighters with me and... and..."
"Now you're making fun of me, Melly. And I'm getting angry. I've been asking you to let me in out of politeness, when I have a key."
"No, No! Wait! Wait!"
"Yes, it's true. But I don't believe you are here just to taunt me... Meet me at the chapel tomorrow at around seven in the evening, friend, and I will explain what happened."
Piss off! Why does everybody taunt me so?
"Sure. I was cleaning the chapel like I am right now, see. I know it was about this time when I suddenly was in the undercroft chapel."
I don't feel like talking right now. Meet me in the chapel later.
"I mean, I was here, and then, suddenly, I was there. At least this is how my mind sees it."
No you don't! I wasn't drunk. I never drink on the job. Each day I take a nap in the afternoon so I'm rested and clean for the job. The priest here is kind enough to give me some money - I know he doesn't have to.
"But I'm no beggar, I want to work for my money."
Never mind. Everybody thinks I'm just a drunk who loses bodies everyday...
Not that I know of. But people are cruel you know...
"Anyway, I was sweeping up, and it seems that I skipped time. I suddenly found myself in the undercroft chapel two hours later, and a priest was asking me why I left the door of the undercroft chapel open."
I have no clue what happened in between but...
I have had nightmares since that night.
"Well not precisely. I always have nightmares about my life... but that's another matter. No, I mean I seem to recall some things from that night. The night the body disappeared."
I remember eyes! Big red scary eyes. They follow me everywhere. They are in my head and I'm leading them to the undercroft chapel.
"I'm scared, I don't know what to do and I'm forced to obey like I can't control my own body..."
"See, madness. It's probably the guilt catching up to me."
"That's the whole story. I was nearly alone in the chapel, the priests were dining in their quarters. And lady Varian's body just disappeared. The lord Varian won't even look at me now. Not that he did before. Anyway..."
Can't say I did really. I'm the uncle of one of his servants you see.
"Yeah. Elizabetha is my niece. We still talk and she told me the lord was really outraged he couldn't have a proper burial for his wife. If it wasn't for her, he might have had me killed."
But he listens to her. She explained that I was not really responsible. A good girl my Elizabetha.
He is nobility you know. He doesn't speak to people like us.
"Sure, I can talk to her. But... what is this to you?"
Hmm. I guess you young people like a good mystery once in a while.
Come to my home later tonight. We can share some dinner and I'll introduce you to my niece. You'll have to convince her to introduce you to lord Varian.
"Sorry child, but I cannot discuss such a grave matter with just anybody."
Ah! You've been speaking with the gossips. Well it is true my child.
"I don't suppose it will harm anyone now, will it?"
"A recently wed woman, Lady Lucy Varian, died about two weeks ago. We had her body in the undercroft chapel ready for burial but the body mysteriously disappeared the night before the funeral."
"Well, that's another matter. We have a poor lad we pay to clean the chapel."
Honestly we would do it ourselves but he insisted on providing a service for the chapel instead of just accepting our charity. So we let him work here on the evenings.
"The night of the body's disappearance, he was cleaning the chapel. After dinner I saw that the undercroft chapel was open, which is unusual. So I went to check in and saw him wandering around."
"The poor lad was probably drunk like always. He claimed he had no memory of how he got there, and that he didn't see anything."
"Still he was the only one, except for the other members of the priesthood here who had access to the undercroft chapel."
He spends most of his day at The Page of Cups. His name is Kelgan. I'm afraid he won't be of much help though.
People are mean sometimes you know. They are teasing him all the time because of this misadventure. The lad is drinking even more now than before.
Child?
May I ask why are you so interested in this matter?
May the Nine guide your path always my child.
May the Nine guide your path always my child.
May the Nine guide your path always my child.
Oh you've heard about it too? A body was stolen from the chapel recently right before the burial! Speak with the priest in the chapel if you're interested.
Perhaps it's like those graverobbers I heard have been stealing from the dead in the Imperial City?
"I don't know, but now that you mention it, I haven't seen him for some time either! Perhaps he went to visit his friend in Cheydinhal, he often mentioned her."
No! Really? Perhaps I should keep a closer eye on the Peregrine family.
Maybe that ogre Baldor ate him?
"They used it to paralyze their victims, and bury them alive. And that's just what I'm gonna do to you. I hope you've made peace with the Nine!"
"Really, this is just too much. How dare you come to me with such an upsetting subject? Clear off you beggar!"
She's right here! Are you blind?
She'll be here soon. Be patient.
"Sorry, but I don't like to talk to strangers about my work."
Yes? I am his maid. Is there anything I can help you with?
Of course. Not very well though. She just came from High Rock I think. The poor thing...
She was all alone here. All her family stayed behind. She was given to Lord Varian in marriage to ensure some trade business among the two families.
And then she got sick and died...
Indeed. Two weeks after coming here she died in pain.
"Not really no. She was in bed all day, looking as pale as a ghost. She was delirious most of the time due to the fever."
She kept blabbering about her husband not being as he seemed.
She was delirious! I guess being forced to marry a man twice her age was too much for her...
Sure Lord Varian is a bit peculiar. I mean...
"Well, it's just that all the other maids I know live at their master's house you know. Yet I am not allowed to live there."
"I couldn't take care of the poor mistress at night. Each evening at 10 o'clock, Lord Varian sent me home."
Like I said I couldn't be of assistance to the Lady while she was sick and...
"The maids at the other houses say Lord Varian finds me too ugly to live in his house. And that he doesn't trust me, not even to get his groceries."
He tells me he has a very specific diet and that I wouldn't know what he needs...
Well I am doing the groceries and the cooking when he has guests for lunch or dinner.
But the rest of the time he cooks for himself. And also does the dishes...
Well I am doing the groceries and the cooking when he has guests for lunch or dinner.
But the rest of the time he cooks for himself. And also does the dishes...
That's not all!
That's not all!
Yes! He follows me all around while I'm tending the house. Well not everywhere but in the main room and in his bedroom.
He is always there pretending to read or write something. Like if I would steal something from him. It is very upsetting.
How so?
Ah yes. It is very strange that one minute he follows me everywhere as if to make sure I'm not a thief...
"and the next minute, he asks me about things like the proper shirt to go with his jacket."
I was able to convince him not to have the guards arrest my uncle. He might have ended up being executed if blamed for Lady Lucy's disappearance!
I was able to convince him not to have the guards arrest my uncle. He might have ended up being executed if blamed for Lady Lucy's disappearance!
What?
You want me to talk to Lord Varian on your behalf?
Oh so you want to talk to him yourself. What's this about?
You'd better tell me or I won't help you.
"Well I'm not sure he would welcome that. He is very private. I'll do what I can, but don't blame me if he is not very friendly."
Give me the morning to speak to him. Come see him in the afternoon... that is unless tomorrow is Tirdas. I don't work on Tirdas you see...
Thank you. It is deeply appreciated.
You mean about her disappearance?
Ah. Well I'm not really versed in medicine. I don't know much about human... biology.
"People! See I'm a salesman. I have many interests in various businesses and I am always busy with them, somewhere..."
"At least I was until I decided to settle down and find a wife, Lucy."
She became very ill the instant we entered Skingrad. And I even had to call a doctor for her!
Yes... He tended to her illness for two weeks before she passed away.
This is getting rather personal... I don't really know you all that well. I don't want to speak any further.
"I did ask him about my Lucy... But I didn't hear anything, I was caught up in my own sorrow. All I know is that she was very sick and he could do nothing for her but to lower her fever."
"I did ask him about my Lucy... But I didn't hear anything, I was caught up in my own sorrow. All I know is that she was very sick and he could do nothing for her but to lower her fever."
"As I said before, I don't know you very well, and I don't feel like talking any further about such personal things."
That's right! I am a very wise human! HA! Haha!
Err... I mean person. That's why I called the doctor.
"Of course! What kind of... human, do you think I am? That's why I called the doctor!"
"Ahh. My apologies, I get so emotional sometimes."
Might I inquire about your tastes in literature?
"Might I suggest Mannimarco, King of Worms. The Arcane University should have a copy."
The Armorer's Challenge should suit you quite nicely. First Edition should have it.
"Ah quite! The Ransom of Zarek is just what you need. If you'll find it anywhere, it'll be in the Arena District."
I believe I came across a copy of Last Scabbard of Akrash in A Fighting Chance. That's the book for you.
As you wish.
"Ah. Not quite my taste, but what you're looking for is in Leyawiin's Southern Books."
He is coming tomorrow. Do you wish to meet him?
He is coming tomorrow. Do you wish to meet him?
You can ask him anything you want about my wife's illness... maybe this time I'll be able to hear what he has to say.
Come back tomorrow in the afternoon. We'll have dinner... Now if you'll excuse me...
See you tomorrow.
You can read? I mean... what do you like to read?
"I think I saw a copy of Cherim's Heart of Anequina, in the First Edition."
Really... you don't seem the type. Well There's a copy of The Black Arts on Trial at the Mystic Emporium.
"They aren't secret if they are published... However, I saw a copy of Calcinator Treatise when I was at the Imperial bridge Inn recently."
"Perhaps I misjudged you, head over to Leyawiin's Southern Books. You'll find what you need."
I'm still not sure I trust your... literacy.
"Yes, I noticed that they seemed to be completely ignoring you, so I guess it's safe for me too."
"Did you notice their armor? It looks quite old, I'd suggest that these may well be Ayleids, and fighting each other, so they must have been rival factions."
"I wonder why they are still here, so long after they died."
"I do hope we will discover the cause of their conflict. Both how it started, and why, as ghosts, they continue even now to fight each other?"
"Oh? There's a boat, a skiff floating in the lava? How intriguing! And you think this switch might set it moving?"
"Well, from what you describe, I would suggest that it lacks power, perhaps that slot underneath the switch is to connect a power source to the skiff."
"Keep exploring, perhaps you will find what you need."
"Oh? There's a boat, a skiff floating in the lava? How intriguing! And you think this switch might set it moving?"
"Well, from what you describe, I would suggest that it lacks power, perhaps that slot underneath the switch is to connect a power source to the skiff."
"Actually it sounds just like what I found connected to that door which won't open, over where you discovered those bodies. The door's connector is broken, but I was able to remove this Welkynd Crystal, perhaps you could use it to power the skiff?"
"Here, try and see. Goodness, a skiff to cross lava. I must say, if I were to use such a vessel, I wouldn't be willing to risk any followers I might have, in case the results weren't what I was expecting."
"Oh yes, while you were gone I attempted to open that door over where you discovered those bodies. I wasn't successful, but it had the same type of connector as the one for the skiff switch."
"The door's connector is broken, but I was able to remove this Welkynd Crystal, perhaps you could use it to power the skiff?"
"Here, try and see. Goodness, a skiff to cross lava. I must say, if I were to use such a vessel, I wouldn't be willing to risk any followers I might have, in case the results weren't what I was expecting."
Good luck. I really hope it won't sink as soon as it's moved away from the shore!
"Hmm? Oh, do you remember that door by the gas trap?  I've learnt quite a bit about Ayleid technology over the years, and I managed to get it to open without a power crystal! There's a portal just behind me leading back to the first cavern."
"These documents are fascinating! From what I can gather, this place was built for the study and practice of using magma as a power source - both mechanically, and magically."
"I think some of the books in these cupboards are records of experiments. What worked or didn't, how long they were able to keep a steady output before something became unstable. That sort of thing."
"My goodness! That must be where and how they died! Boiled to death by clouds of steam, how horrid."
"If they were running when they died, then they must have known something was coming, and tried to flee. But they weren't fast enough."
"I should put a team together from the guild to search the remains in the passage, perhaps we can find more about them and how this happened."
"Yes, it sounded awful, though I would have liked to witness this vision myself. First hand experience is always better than hearing from others."
Please see if you can access any of the other rooms. There could be more documents or something else of interest. Perhaps even some of the machinery they must have been testing down here.
"Oh, I almost forgot! There's another of those power crystals in the cupboard here, you should take it with you, just in case you come across another door or skiff needing power."
"Um, you know you already asked me that?  Look around, see if you can find anything interesting."
Hmm... and what exactly do you expect to find?
I see... you should probably talk to Falanu Hlaalu. She has an alchemist shop here in Skingrad.
"Hmmm... sure, I can try to identify this and tell you where it came from. But..."
Where did you get it?
Oh! Aren't you secretive? That's fine with me. Life can get so boring around here. This will bring some excitement into my usual routine.
Just come back tomorrow evening before I close the shop and I should have the results.
"Yes! Yes... Most interesting flesh... er, meat, you have there. Sure you don't want to tell me where you got it?"
"I can't talk now, a customer may come in and I don't wish to discuss this in front of others. Come see me in the evening after seven, just before I close the shop."
"Fine, fine! But this is not ordinary meat you see. I have to know what you want with it."
"I can't help you if you don't tell me everything, I don't know you well enough to trust you."
"Fine, fine! But this is not ordinary meat you see. I have to know what you want with it."
I'll help you but you'll owe me one. The meat you gave me is human flesh!
I'll help you but you'll owe me one. The meat you gave me is human flesh!
There are several reasons for someone to have this kind of ingredient. But most of them are not very... how can I put it? Orthodox...
There are several reasons for someone to have this kind of ingredient. But most of them are not very... how can I put it? Orthodox...
"Well now that necromancy has been declared outlawed in Cyrodiil, everything one would do with that would be considered a crime. That is if the purpose is to use it in some magical spells. Now if it is just for eating, that is just plain wrong!"
Well the flesh has been treated just like you would treat pork meat. Which suggests...
Still not telling me where you got it from?
Just be careful then. You don't know what kind of monster uses this kind of ingredient and even less for what purpose. I suppose whatever it is it won't be pleasant to make an enemy of it.
"Oh! I would advise caution in dealing with aristocracy. You don't want to go accusing them of anything unless you can prove what you are saying and even then, it will have to be pretty damn convincing for anyone to hear you."
I must complete the sequence...
That's the first...
...not enough time!
And the second...
Why did we design it this way?
"Third done, just one more..."
"What was that?! Are they coming already? No, no I'm just imagining things."
Why isn't the portal working? I must reach the activation chamber before it's too late.
"Now that I have set the self-destruct sequence I must activate the device, before the invaders kill everyone who knows how dangerous the device is if left running."
"It is done. No, wait, no! Something's wrong! But I know this is the right page for the sequence."
"No, no, no! Did I set the controls wrong? Perhaps there is still time to correct this!"
We are free!
"Oh my goodness, you just went ahead and activated this device without determining first what it does? That was most foolish, what if it had killed you, or blown up and destroyed the whole chamber?"
"You see?! This is most frustrating, how could you be so reckless to destroy this ancient Ayleid device, we might have learnt so much from it."
"But... doing so must be what released the ghosts to Aetherius, so I supposed you did do the right thing."
And clearly there are many more chambers and rooms to find and explore. Perhaps there will be another such device still intact? One can only hope.
Here is 100 gold for your efforts. I think we can continue without you now.
"This was in the device chamber, and contains diagrams related to usage of the device? Fascinating. Thank you, this book will greatly help with our understanding of the device."
"I know, you told me. Do you still want to keep it for yourself, or would you now be willing to let me have it?"
"Now this is very rare! I know a few collectors who would be interested in this, so I'm willing to offer 500 gold if you'll sell it to me?"
"Yes, yes, quite fascinating I'm sure."
"I suppose I could give you 300 gold for it, though I'll simply be adding it to the pile of Ayleid books I already own."
"Thank you so much, it looks like I may be able to cross reference some of these pages with the log books I found in this room."
"I have so much work to do here, please forgive me but I want to start translating this book right away."
"But... you're here at my request, at the request of the Archaeology Guild. Surely you understood that our interest here is in items just like this book."
"I see. Very well. I have much work to do here, I trust you can find your way out."
"Hm, cheeky of you. Well I don't have much gold left after paying you for your help. I can only offer 100 gold, I do hope you'll agree."
"Okay, then here is another 100 gold, and I shall keep the book."
"And now, I have much work to do here, I trust you can find your way out."
Splendid! Then here is your gold. I may be able to arrange an auction.
"Oh. I really thought you'd reject that offer. Ah well, here's your gold."
As you wish. I doubt you'll find a better offer from anyone else though.
"Well that's fine, I didn't really want it anyway."
He is here as I said. Feel free to talk to him. I already told him about you.
The doctor will be joining me this afternoon.
"I'm afraid you missed him. You really should have come when I told you to. He visits Skingrad every week, and he dines with me each time he visits."
Yes! Yes!!! I know exactly what you're here for. Yes I do.
Won't you sit down? I'll strain my neck looking up at you.
"He did! I know you want to know about his wife. How she lived, how she died and the rest."
"I am... was her doctor. That's who I am. I can tell you things. Things about her illness, anyhow."
"It all started about a week before she died. Baldor contacted me because his wife was sick. And sick she was. She was pale and very weak. I thought she had caught a bad flu, but I was wrong. Very wrong."
She'd been bitten!
"Well if you know any kind of insect that drains the vital fluids out of your veins then yes. But if not, er, guess not."
"Well, if you take into account the fact that she became allergic to sunlight, began to sleep all day and vomited whenever presented with garlic, I'd say yes!"
Well neither did I to start with. The vampires of Cyrodiil don't usually linger with their prey. They just drain them and get it over with. They are savage creatures without any control. I heard about cases of vampirism in other provinces though...
In Morrowind for instance there are three different families of vampire. Each have their own hierarchy and live in a civilised manner compared to the savage vampires we have here.
I won't bore you with the details though. Enough to say that I suspect a vampire from another province has taken the blood of Lucy.
"Thinking on it now, it seems obvious that she was infected by a vampire, she may now have turned into one herself."
"Not really. I'm not from this town you see. In fact I'm not from any town really. I travel a lot, going where the patients need me. I think Baldor can help you more with that."
It seems I didn't pay enough attention to what the good doctor was saying before. A vampire! Can you believe that? Here in Skingrad! I thought... we were safe here...
Not really no... though maybe... I don't know.
"I have a friend... well, to say an acquaintance would be more appropriate, who was visiting us soon after we came to settle in Skingrad. He became really close to my poor Lucy. Now that I think of it, he only visited us in the evenings."
Which is easily explained because he had other duties during the day I gather...
"Oh that is of no importance now. He left town on some business trip, not long before Lucy passed away. So he couldn't be responsible."
What do you mean hiding? You think he could have prepared all this and pretended to leave just to be able to snatch the corpse of my dear Lucy?
"Well we have to know! He is not here so we have to... No, you will investigate his house. The house of course will be locked. But I am a noble and I can ask the guards for a key that will open this house."
You will meet me tomorrow morning and I will give you that key. I'll also mark the house on your map so you won't enter the wrong house.
No worries. The guards won't bother you. I will explain to them that you were sent by me to recover some documents the baron forgot to give me before his departure.
The guards know better than to question a lord's word in this town.
So I will see you tomorrow then.
Well I have some reasons to be upset.
"No, I don't think so, unless you can explain some unexpected night-visits to my house recently?"
I thought not. So can we please get to the point.
Yes! I have it right here. It was not as easy as I thought to get it. They asked me to sign a lot of papers.
He is the Baron von Zarov. He comes from an old family here in Skingrad. Very respected and well connected.
"You need to find proof that the baron is the vampire we seek. If he is, there must be some kind of clue in the house. I don't know what to look for precisely but I guess you'll know when you find it."
"Remember: don't take anything else from the property, only any proof that he is a vampire."
Of course citizen. What is this about?
Found in a house? And which house might that be?
That's a serious accusation. Do you have any sort of proof to back up your story?
Move along then.
So you go around snooping in noblemen's houses? You better get lost before I arrest you for theft and trespassing.
Are you sure about that? Who told you it was human meat?
"Even so, you have no proof that it came from his house have you? It was not a sanctioned investigation you were pursuing. So I could arrest you for trespassing in a nobleman's house..."
I think you'd better get lost before I have to arrest you for carrying human meat and for accusing one of the nobles of Skingrad without any shred of proof.
The invaders attacked through the silver gate. Our guards teleported across the lava to fight back.
"At first, it looked like we would prevail, but then more invaders appeared far on the other side of the caverns. Some of the guards were recalled to fight this second force, and so there were too few left to hold the first force back."
"We knew that if the invaders won, they would use the device for destruction rather than for the positive benefits we were seeking."
"But worst of all, we were in the middle of running another experiment with the device, and it was building a powerful charge of energy."
You must do what Ulydalar failed to do. You must deactivate the device for good!
"I can feel the energy which has built up over thousands of years, and I know, I know that it has nearly reached its limit!"
"Very soon, the full force of charged energy will be released straight upward to the surface, and when it does, whatever civilization now exists up there will be destroyed."
Not even another uncontrolled release of the charged energy will make any difference now.
"It all went wrong. Everything, went wrong."
We had to stop the experiment!
"If the invaders killed all of us before the experiment was stopped, then it would continue to charge up until eventually the energy would be released as an explosion, one so powerful it would wipe out everything on the surface for hundreds of miles."
And that is when everything went wrong.
Ulydalar went to the control room to set the sequence so that we could safely disable the device and allow the energy to dissipate toward the core of Nirn.
"I ordered everyone else to evacuate the device room, and only learnt later that Terdeyrgonyl had turned off the control room portal to keep the invaders out, so Ulydalar could not return swiftly."
"Then, there was shouting from everywhere, and people were running in every direction, but they weren't running from the invaders."
Suddenly we were engulfed in clouds of boiling steam. Ulydalar must have entered the wrong sequence then made it back to activate the device thinking this would disable it.
"An uncontrolled release of the charged energy, blasting outward through every cavern, down every corridor, into every room. Everyone died!"
And yet... we are still here.
"I sensed that his spirit was destroyed. I am now the last of my family still alive, and the line must end with me."
"I will tell you one more secret of Ruun: you may think that I, Ma Syd Jun and his sister are the only survivors of Ruun, but this is not so. If you have read my diary, then you know I was once as evil as Oron."
"But once the truth of my deeds was revealed to me, I took it upon myself to save as many of the surviving peasants as I could, so I created a refuge for the betrayed of Ruun to live on."
"Named Blood Castle in memory of the innocents I slaughtered, you may now take command in my place if you so wish. There was another item of value near my diary. Polish it, and you will be transported to Blood Castle."
"I thank you for your efforts. I must leave now, you will never see me again."
"Oh! Then you certainly did the right thing, I apologize for calling you foolish. Your actions seem to have released the ghosts to Aetherius, too."
And clearly there are many more chambers and rooms to find and explore. Perhaps there will be another such device still intact? One can only hope.
I shall send a message back to my Guild letting them know of the disaster you have averted this day.
"Here is 100 gold for your efforts, it doesn't seem enough of a reward for saving Cyrodiil from being destroyed, but it's all I am authorized to give you. I think we can continue without you now."
This is where I first saw Marcus. He was very handsome in his armor. So noble. But he didn't even look at me.
"Manius did not come with me to the shrine. And I didn't know anyone in Leyawiin yet... I think Marcus was from Blackwood. Yes, he was the commander of their unit. But he rarely visited the city. My husband called him a seeker."
Manius even started to get a little jealous. Although I only ever admired from afar... But I would not forget Marcus either. Let him stay with me. Forever and ever.
Now go to the castle library. I feel a memory pulling me there.
"It's always quiet here... I could stay for hours, leaf through books, look out the window, think. My husband was always busy, and I..."
"But sometimes Tsavi came. She knows how to talk. Knows how to captivate. I asked so many questions, I was curious. She was so sweet. So kind. So smart."
"And this strange way of the Khajiit, talking about yourself in the third person. [QUOTE]This one[QUOTE], [QUOTE]She[QUOTE]. It sounded funny to me, but Tsavi was not offended. She was very generous."
Leave my memories of Tsavi with me and go to the cemetery. There I will tell you what happened next.
Did you find anything relevant yet?
Show me what you found.
So you think she has been turned into a vampire by the baron?
"Alright, then what are you going to do now?"
That may be premature. Plus we don't know yet where he took my wife's body. Nor if she is dead or a vampire. We need to find her first. Do you have any idea where to look for the baron?
Good thinking. Do you have any idea where to look for him?
"Hmm. I don't think so. You started this and you need to see it through now. I want to know what happened to my wife, and if she is a vampire I want to know where she is."
"If this is a matter of gold, I will pay you. I just need to know what happened. Do you have any idea where to look for the baron?"
You know where to start then.
You know where to start then.
"I can't believe that you would abandon me like this. Well if you change your mind, come see me."
"As a child, I was afraid of the dark. I was very afraid. My mother would take me to the Nocturnal Shrine to give my toys as an offering, and my collections of flowers and feathers."
"After marrying Manius, I would come here sometimes. Manius did not approve. But I wasn't afraid of the dark anymore."
"It is you again. Are you going to take away my memory? It's so quiet, isn't it? It's always quiet here. And books all around, so many books. I'm never bored here."
Soon... It won't be long. It's calm here. But do not go into the tomb. They showed me what is down there... They are so brave.
"I worked with Tsavi and Elendar. Or rather it was they who worked, and I helped. When I wasn't a hindrance. Usually I was, you know?"
And that night we wanted to enter the tomb of the Invels. But nothing came of it. Elendar could not open the door. It was dark and a little eerie. Tsavi hissed.
"Then something escaped from there and knocked us down! We lay unconscious until the morning. I was very scared, and so was Tsavi. Only Elendar..."
No! I'm suffocating... I cannot!
I'm not afraid of corpses. Or creatures. But he is not a corpse. He is alive! And he's terrible! He is like a black shadow.
"He became a monster. Poor Marcus. He accidentally came out when I was alone in the dining room. I didn't see him at first, I only heard the door bang."
I turned and saw the open door...
"I was too curious. I went down the ladder into the basement, and saw Marcus there in the dark..."
He was talking with two Argonians in black clothes. And they themselves were black. I wanted to scream... I must have fainted.
"They were so gentle. The Invels. They said that I was unwell. They gave me a drink... It tasted a little bitter. My head ached. And the next day, they sent me flowers."
They smelled so... sweet and bitter! I threw them out. Everything felt so strange. As if I was expecting a baby again. Pain and vomiting... I did not tell my husband.
And then it was too late. And that silly quarrel. Why did I tell him about Elendar's feelings! How stupid I was.
Let's finish this. Then only death...
"Ah, so you've changed your mind? Very good, so do you have any idea where to look for the baron?"
"I have no idea who that may be, sorry."
"Jo'Rakha does not, sorry."
"Of course, she works here in the Tack and Supplies shop, and rents a bed from Gwendolyn Saldaron."
Sure! You can find her working at Magh-Gra's Tack and Supplies.
"Everything is so clear, as if it was quite recent... but our daughters were born and have grown up. We were going to wed in the Temple of the One, in the Imperial City."
"But then Manius was transferred to Leyawiin. The count wanted him here, and I agreed to wed here instead. The wedding was so lovely. Although there were almost no guests."
I was so young...
"Yes, I want to keep this memory... This and another... At the Nocturnal Shrine. It's not far from the city. Please save that memory!"
What news do you bring from those ruins. Did you find our missing ranger?
So you say the lower level is a source of unending evil?
This is most disappointing.
"Yes, blocking access to the lower level, I understand. I guess that would be best for Cyrodiil if we did that. After all we wouldn't want to be the cause of the release of those undead creatures..."
We want this place safe.
I suppose you have the right to know. After all you are the one doing the job aren't you?
"Well, we need a safer place to organise an important meeting among the leaders of the Guild. We are not without enemies."
Of course the guild is still young here and you wouldn't know about it but we have been around for quite some time now and we made our share of foes.
"The emperor here saw us as the benevolent guild that we are but in some other provinces, we were not so welcome by the official authorities, for the simple reason that they were corrupted."
So we did our best to help the people against them and by doing so we attracted the ire of powerful foes.
I won't go into the details but it is enough to say that we must not tread lightly and any high ranking guild meeting has to be held in the safest place there is.
These ruins are completely remote and untouched for ages. They do look like the perfect spot for the meeting I have in mind. But of course we must ensure the safety of our members as well as the safety of this province so you must seal the lower level.
Good luck to you and try not to get killed. I'll wait for your return and send the invitation to our leaders as I have total faith in your abilities. Farewell.
A meeting? With whom?
Hmmm. Do you know why there?
"I see. So they claim to have enemies. That is most curious. In all my inquiries about the guild activities in the other provinces, I never heard of them being threatened or having any enemies."
Yet the guildmasters in the other provinces seem more open than those of the Cyrodiil branch.
"We need to know what they are planning and if they go to such troubles to ensure the safety of this meeting, it is most certainly a meeting we need to have eyes and ears in."
"I'm sure the mages of the Daggers will figure something out. If not, we will give you instructions on how to gather the information we need. We will leave a message for you at the Gold Horse Courier in Bruma."
"I suspect we won't be able to contact you once the meeting is set, they will surely reinforce security among their ranks."
That will be all. I'll tell aunt Vana how much you enjoyed her cookies.
"Certainly, we just received this letter for you, and the delivery costs are already paid."
Pleasure doing business with you!
What can you possibly want with him?
"I don't know you well enough, wouldn't you rather buy something?"
Well you're out of luck. The baron left some time ago.
"I guess so, you seem to be nice enough. Well you're out of luck. The baron left some time ago."
In good company he was too.
It is! A nice lady too. You know those high society types. Fair skin and stunningly beautiful.
She had this milky white skin with really bright eyes... almost as if they were shining in the night.
"Oh yes! The baron needed some new riding gear for two horses, but he was so busy he could only come to the shop in the evening. He asked me to send this note when the riding gear was ready for collection."
I think they went in the direction of Chorrol. The baron told me he wanted to stop at Fort Carmala for the night though. Let me mark it on your map.
I'm happy to help!
"Thank you, thank you. I am too young to die."
What do you want me to tell you? I'll tell you everything.
No!!!
"I'm Lady Lucy Varian. I was saved from my demented husband by my saviour, Baron von Zarov."
My husband is a monster! I don't know what kind of monster but I know he is one. I asked the help of my only friend the Baron and he did what he could to save me.
No! It's you who doesn't understand. I know I'm a vampire now. But it was the only way to be safe from Baldor Varian. You see I had to be dead for him to let me go.
I was married to him only a few weeks and each night I was locked up in some cage he made for me. We never even consummated our wedding... for which I'm glad.
But he's not human! No human would treat a newly-wed bride this way.
I couldn't involve them. He would have killed them. We had another servant before and I made the mistake of talking to him. I don't know how Baldor knew I did but soon after the servant disappeared.
It is better to live as a creature of the night than as a weak sequestrated wife.
I don't know. He left me here with these vampires to teach me how to be one of them. He said he had some other matters to take care of and that he'll be back for me soon. He went to another province while I'm training here.
"No, I don't think so. The Baron is a kind and faithful friend. He saved me while he could have let me rot with my husband. He devised the whole plan to make me look dead."
"You don't understand him as I do. But he only wanted to protect me, I think he is in love with me. Though he never actually said anything about it. He is shy and respectful like this."
"If you want proof of my husband's misbehavior, you should explore Grayrock Cave. Elizabetha once told me that he has been seen near there quite often by travelers."
"If you want proof of my husband's misbehavior, you should explore Grayrock Cave. Elizabetha once told me that he has been seen near there quite often by travelers."
"You're welcome. You shouldn't try to confront Baldor yourself though. He has magical powers and he is really strong. Now I must rest, please leave me."
No!!!
Oh? You have found some proof already?
"How awful! Sorry, I'm still adjusting to the whole drinking human blood thing... You shouldn't try to confront Baldor yourself though. He has magical powers and he is really strong."
"Now I must rest, please leave me."
Never heard that name.
"Sorry but I don't know anyone by that name. You should probably check the castle, seeing as he is a noble..."
You should ask the countess's entourage. I never heard that name though...
"Sorry, but I have never heard of that name. Maybe her Ladyship knows?"
The Baron von Zarov has not been in Chorrol for ages. I think I remember my father's journals mentioning the visit of a Baron when I was a young girl.
"I never saw him in person myself though. He must be dead by now, surely?"
"It must be his heir then. But no, I never had the pleasure to meet him. Sorry."
Yes? You talked to him right?
What do you want to know now?
"Except for what I already told you before, nothing. He is a Lord, so he can be rude with little people sometimes but he is always nice to me."
I guess he likes me...
"Yes. When he is not having guests, he cooks for himself."
He says they are his family recipes and he is the only one who can prepare a meal as his mother did for him.
I don't know what you want me to say but he's a good master. He's grieving for his wife whose body's disappeared so you'd better leave him alone now.
Goodbye.
Sure. Show me what you need to translate please.
These were written by ogres. I'm sorry but this is beyond my knowledge.
I can think of several people but your best chance would be Boderi Farano.
She resides at the Arcane University in the Imperial City.
Certainly. I will ask her to come here to meet you. Wait here please.
"Ah, you were here about a week ago, weren't you? Yes, wait here, Boderi will join you shortly."
If I can help I will of course. Show me what this is about...
Yes I recognise this language. It is Ogrish. It is fairly rare to find so much written in this language. The Ogres are not very clever and only a little few among them bothers with learning to write and read.
"My, my. Aren't you impatient? I can't tell you their exact content for now but from the look of it you have a cooking recipe book here, a spell book there and what seems to be a novel or a journal of some sort there."
I can tell you that this spell book might belong to a mage. The recipes are mundane but I need to look a bit more into it to know for sure. So why don't you come back in... a week or so.
Well yes. I can have some of my assistants working on a translation of these books but these things take time you know. One week for the three books is the best I can do.
"I must return to my studies now, please come back in a week."
I have good news and bad news.
The bad news is that we can't give them back to you. They contain forbidden knowledge comparable to necromancy and as such we can't let them out of the Arcane University even if very few people would be able to read them.
The good news however is that we made an excerpt of the journal with all the important entries about this case that you can have.
There was a spell and alchemy book with various shamanic spells we have already seen ogres use and some interesting alchemical recipes. You will understand after reading the journal.
The last book was a nasty cook book which involved things such as human meat and goblin brains among other things.
"All these books form the proof that the person you know as Lord Varian is in fact an ogre who consumed the real lord Varian's flesh to take his form, and his brain to absorb his memory."
For sure he is. It seems that consuming the brain of his victims allowed this ogre to increase his intelligence for some time.
Here is a letter you should show to the proper authorities in Skingrad. It has the Mages Guild seals and should be sufficient to have the guards arrest Lord Varian.
Now I need to return to my studies. These books have put me behind in my work.
Alright citizen. What sort of crime do you want to report?
"Stop right there. If it concerns nobility, you'd better talk to Dion, captain of the town guard. He's the only one who can handle this situation."
"Certainly citizen. We need more concerned people like you. Now, may I know what this is about?"
Hold on! Lord Varian is one of our most respected nobles here in town. And you are suggesting he is not who we think he is?
Proof you say? That should be interesting. Show it to me please.
"Okay look, it seems that you have indeed evidence but I can't act solely on that. The Count needs to be informed about this. I suggest you go to the castle right away and tell the steward I sent you."
Oh yes?
I see. I take it you have some evidence of this?
All this seems very official. I guess you didn't want your target to escape right?
Yes. Accusing a Lord of Skingrad without any backup evidence would have lead you nowhere. Thanks for taking the precautions of making this all official.
The Count will be pleased that you handled this like you did.
I'll talk to the Count as soon as possible and I expect there'll be an arrest tomorrow morning. You are welcome to watch it but you must not intervene. This is a matter for the guards of this city.
You know where to start then.
You know where to start then.
Then kindly leave me alone until you feel up to the task.
"Well, this is a job for the local city guards now, so you stay out of the way, alright?"
"Very good. Move in, men!"
"Commendable, but I can't allow that. Only city guards and legion soldiers are authorised to make arrests."
"Move in, men!"
"Sir, he's changed into an ogre, and he's using magic! I don't think we can handle this on our own."
It seems we have the final piece of evidence to back up your accusation.
"My men need assistance, I'd better go in so my magic can support them. Unless..."
You still want to help?
"Alright, in you go. I had wanted to take this imposter alive, but it seems that is no longer an option."
"Very true. Stay here, we'll have this resolved shortly."
"A pity we could not arrest him, but you did well."
"Indeed it is. The castle steward may offer a reward for this, you should come up and see when you're able to."
"Indeed it is. The castle steward may offer a reward for this, you should come up and see when you're able to."
Now to get this imposter into a jail cell.
"Ah! Here you are! We've been waiting for you. Too bad though, you just missed the Count. He was called away for another duty."
"Never mind though, I'm here to officiate on his behalf and it is my great honour to give you this reward for all your efforts in this dramatic case. It is especially the way you handled the situation that you are commended for."
You went to extreme lengths to gather information and proof to back up your findings in this matter and you did Skingrad a great service.
"Without you, who knows how long this monster could have preyed on the innocent people of Skingrad using the disguise of nobility which in most cases is very hard to go against."
So you really deserve this reward as well as the fame accorded only to people of valour.
It was my pleasure to meet such a responsible citizen. Thank you for everything you've done.
"Of course you forgot! I had a job, do you remember? I had some money to put food on my uncle's table and to pay for the other things like repairs and taxes."
"But thanks to you I have nothing! Soon my uncle and I will be mere beggars for you to mock or give coins to, to unburden your conscience."
"Really? And what good is that to me? In two weeks the tax collectors will come and we will have nothing to give, so they will take our house and throw us on the streets. But everyone considers you a hero!"
How come only the little people have to pay the price for the big heroes' deeds?
I despise you! pttt!!!
Now get out of this house before I call the guards on you for trespassing while this house is still ours.
"Of course it's not! How can it be your fault if I have no job, no money, and very soon no house? I must have mistaken you for someone who took my master away. So sorry!"
Now get off this property and go do your heroic acts in someone else's town! You still have plenty of lives to ruin.
Well it certainly looks that way to me. Though I know you didn't make Baldor an ogre. My uncle lost everything and now I have nothing to support this household.
I'm sorry I've been such a... well you know. But everything is going wrong for us. Leave us be now.
And never come back!
What?!
To give me the money you got as a reward? Really?
Thank you.
"For me?... us? So you didn't forget after all! Thank you, thank you! You really are a hero!"
"For me?... us? So you didn't forget after all! Thank you, thank you! You really are a hero!"
Well I'm astonished! But you let me go on insulting you? I apologise for that... Thank you very much! We will never forget you.
Have you seen our special guest in the jails? He was once Lord Baldor Varian you know!
Well he's not much of what he used to be if you ask me. He only grunts like the ogre he is now. Well at least they say he is an ogre.
"Looks like a normal human being to me. But they say he was an ogre, and also a mage! Can you believe it?"
Go on! You can try to talk to him! Don't expect him to tell you anything though.
"Unless you understand ogre language. You don't, right?"
Have fun then making any sense of his grunting! Ahahaha!!!
"The Rangers Guild is dedicated to maintaining a balance between nature and the expansion of civilisation, as well as scouting for the Empire when needed."
"Our tasks are vital to maintaining the stability of the Empire, but we also have smaller tasks which benefit the general population."
"Being in the guild makes my life worthwhile. It is so important that we work to keep the wilderness outside our city walls safe, both for the people, and the wildlife. Let me know if you'd like to join up."
"If you want to join up, speak to Lihandril in Chorrol, Moorswind in Skingrad, or Falwin in Leyawiin."
"Yes, I think we can take on a new member right now. Should I sign you up?"
"Excellent, welcome to the Rangers Guild, Associate! Speak to myself or Lihandril in Chorrol if you're looking for a task."
"Welcome Associate, to the Rangers Guild. If you're looking for a task, speak to me, or go see Moorswind in Skingrad."
"Very good, you are now an Associate in the Rangers Guild. Seek out either Lihandril in Chorrol or Moorswind in Skingrad if you're looking for a task."
"Well, if you change your mind, the position will probably still be available."
Sure! You can have a personal safe with us for only 200 septims.
"Fine, here is the key to your safe. The vault door is on your left. Downstairs, clients are accompanied by security. The bank thanks you for your trust!"
"That's okay. You can rent a safe from us at any time, as soon as you have the money."
"Oh, yes. Thank you for responding. Our company adheres to the principle of unconditional trust in its experienced employees."
"Unfortunately, we cannot always check the loyalty of each employee. So sometimes the company..."
"Ahem... I'm sorry. In short, we suspect that one of our men stole some money and ran away with it."
His name is Bertrand Lumier. Our trusted messenger. He usually carried mail and money to pay for special orders.
"Oh, that doesn't matter. Part of working with rich clients. Their orders often require special attention. Bertrand Lumier worked with them for several years."
We had recently prepared documents and money for the next order. But Lumier disappeared. The money and documents disappeared with him.
Five thousand septims and important correspondence. Including our plans for the development of trade and future clients.
"Believe me, the papers are much more valuable. Our esteemed head, First Counselor Lady Maria Invel, has offered to give the entire stolen sum to you."
The company only needs the documents. They are sewn into a tight brown bag and sealed with magic. Bertrand could not open them.
Bring us this package and the five thousand septims will be yours.
"How should I know? I am a simple branch manager. However, you may want to ask our partners."
"Wine merchant Lebon Dombale, textile merchant Florian Veturius. Perhaps someone else. But start with these."
"And, please, try not to draw too much attention to the search for Bertrand. I wish you luck."
We weren't particularly close. We mostly talked about business. But he helped me a couple of times. I can't imagine he would steal money and run away.
I hope Bertrand will be found and everything cleared up. We drank together a couple of times. He talked about his adventures. A brave man.
"Ah, Lamarche told me he'd seek your assistance. How can I help? Although I knew Bertrand well, he never spoke a word about his work."
"We often used to sit in the Five Claws Lodge. We talked about this and that. Bertrand has seen a lot. But he didn't talk about business, no."
"Yes, I know him. We talked. Although our companies are not members of a trade union, they are not competitors either. So Bertrand Lumier came to see me."
"As a rule, we exchanged news and talked a little about the politics of the Empire in general. And that is all."
"Oh. I do not know anything. I never saw him, Bertrand Lumier always harnessed Thunder himself. He only paid us for Thunder's stay."
"I do not know. Bertrand Lumier left when I was not here. Ask Atahba, she saw him leave."
"He was killed. Thunder was startled and bolted. I feared he would throw me off, which would have killed me, but he just ran with all his might. Then Thunder broke his leg, and I had to walk to the city."
"When I saw my uncle die, I immediately understood everything. It was One-Eye who killed him. Who previously came to him at Five Claws."
"I don't know. If he went his usual way, then he definitely took his favorite stallion from the stable. He called it Thunder. Bertrand always rode it."
"Check whether he took Thunder. Ask at the Five Riders Stables, see if Atahba or Cat-Face knows something."
"Eh, Bertrand, Bertrand. I did not expect this from him. He seemed experienced and reliable, incorruptible. But..."
"Then he ran away, and took his nephew, Jacques, with him. Ask Jacques, if you can find him. He should know where to look for Bertrand."
"I don't know that. To me, the news that Bertrand has stolen the money seems very strange. He was devoted to the Trans-Niben."
"He rode along the road. To the mouth of the Panther, I heard him say. And the boy went with him. He jumped up from behind. This is not good, Thunder does not like to carry two."
"They left late, yes. They were afraid that the bridge would be opened. But I don't know anything else."
"The boy was with him. A nephew, or something. Bertrand taught him everything he knew. I wanted to recommend Jacques to Lebon, but he has his own people already."
"I would not refuse a smart assistant, but I had nowhere for him to live. Only now there is neither Jacques nor Bertrand himself."
"Yes, his nephew was with him. Bertrand even wanted to send Jacques to study with me. But his family in Skingrad did not approve. I haven't seen him for a long time."
"Bertrand? Where from! He's just a messenger. He delivered, of course, many things, but nothing that would get him killed. And he didn't really know very much."
"He kept silent to us about his affairs, and we kept silent about ours. We may have been competitors, but there were no enemies."
"No, he had no obvious enemies. On the contrary, he was friends with many. He often visited Colovian Traders and Southern Books. He was definitely friends with Boner Droz."
"He exchanged books with Bugak gro-Bol. However, he argued not so long ago with the young Orius. They say Lady Maria had to intervene."
But then everything was resolved. Even formally announced by the company.
"Who doesn't have them! But Bertrand, he just had no serious enemies. Stanus Orius had a minor dispute with him but lost interest, and the rest - such minor things. Riffraff."
"Well there's Gold Horse Couriers, but they mostly handle low-value packages, so they're hardly in the same league as Trans-Niben."
"Then there's the Topal Trading Company, but they have several ships and transport all across Tamriel, they wouldn't be concerned with Trans-Niben."
"Perhaps the Imperial Trading Company? We crossed their path often. Lebon took all the wine supplies for himself, which is most serious, and I interfered with their access to the fabric market."
"And Lady Maria, she turns over so much money that it's scary to think. No joke, almost half of the trade with Niben and Elsweyr goes through her."
"And Bertrand, it seems, had to carry not only money. They said that important letters were missing. Is that so? No, don't tell me. I don't need to know."
"With money, Bertrand was all right, he didn't need more. They could hardly buy him. But they could intimidate."
"Hmm, I still use Gold Horse Couriers to make local deliveries, they have no issues with Trans-Niben."
"We do have one competitor here. Imperial Trading Company. With the support of the count, they hoped for great profits. But so far they have not succeeded."
"And Bertrand was small fry to them. Of course, Bertrand was being watched a little, even here. But nothing serious."
"No, the Imperials wouldn't try something so serious. Talk to Florian Veturius."
"Of course. Yes, you should have already been told. But that is just a concern for the heads of the companies. Bertrand himself is too insignificant."
"Well, why not? The Imperial Trading Company has a lot of associates here. They have their own people in the port and in the castle."
"Well, this is all just an assumption. I don't know anything specific. You talk to Lebon Dombale and Boner Droz at the Colovian Traders."
"Bertrand? Doubtful. He is certainly not a hero, but he is not a coward either. Experienced, he does not get lost in stressful situations. No, hardly."
"I'm sorry, but I still have to unpack some goods, so..."
"I followed him. When Thunder fell, I went back through the bushes, along the road. And there I learnt everything. He almost caught me."
"I was just beside the body of my uncle, two of One-Eye's bandits were standing near. I heard them swearing at One-Eye as he took everything from my uncle for himself."
"I waited until they were gone, and headed to the city. They just said that the boy escaped. Me, that is to say. And One-Eye ordered them to search along the road."
"They did not think that I'd go to the city. But they must have found Thunder, and soon they will start looking for me everywhere. Help me. I'll show you where One-Eye is."
"No, if I just tell you, you'll leave me here. I'll go with you. I can run after a horse on foot. I'll show you the way, and then you will kill One-Eye."
I need to retrieve a package with papers from One-Eye.
"There's all sorts of letters, bills and important agreements. I helped my uncle assemble the package and sewed it up myself. They should definitely be retrieved."
I will take them to Lady Maria and ask her to employ me in place of Uncle Bertrand to work in the company. She will not refuse me if I have the papers.
"And you can have the money. There was plenty, I saw it myself. Well, agreed?"
"So he wanted to bribe my uncle. At first he said that he came from a client, from Chorrol. He even gave a secret password. And then he started offering money to my uncle."
"Well, so then my uncle gave him the documents. But my uncle was suspicious when One-Eye said [QUOTE]I'll be seeing you[QUOTE]. Uncle decided to leave quickly."
"I thought at first, that he would speak some more, but all he said was [QUOTE]now there is no need to waste time[QUOTE]. Then One-Eye's men blocked the road."
"It was too late, they were already waiting for us. And they killed my uncle. So can you help me?"
Then let's go. I shall direct you to where One-Eye is camped.
"I'm a little late but, as I understand it, you already have the Trans-Niben documents. Isn't that right?"
"Well, why lie? I feel the magic of the protection spell on the package of documents. And so I know exactly where they are now."
"So we'll continue the conversation, shall we? I will ask you again, do you have the documents?"
"Excellent. Then I am authorised to offer you a modest deal. You give me the documents, I give you five thousand septims. And everyone is happy."
Hmm. Then you leave me no choice.
"Good money is good money, right? A very wise decision!"
"The boy is smart, which means he is a hindrance. He needs to be neutralized."
"That's a pity. Are you sure about that? Understand, these are very important papers worth very serious sums."
And what about Bertrand Lumier and Jacques? We know that Jacques had returned and found you. What happened to them?
I will report the results to Lady Maria Invel. It is very unfortunate that everything ended so sadly. Such a shame.
"But, since there are no results, then, of course, there will be no payment either. I think you understand me quite clearly?"
Then I say goodbye to you. All the best.
Great! Let me take the papers. I hope the financial side of the issue also satisfies you?
"I am glad to hear it. Oh is young Jacques with you? A very, very intelligent young man. We must take care of his fate."
The Trans-Niben Company will pay Jacques everything that was due to Bertrand Lumier. I also recommend talking to Lebon Dombale about a place for Jacques. Thank you again!
"I'm sorry for Bertrand, but I'm glad Jacques survived. We will of course take care of the boy."
"Moreover, he managed to track down the bandits and lead you to their camp. Bertrand has said many times that Jacques is smart and will go far."
"I'll talk to Milena. It is hard for her alone now, so Jacques has arrived just in time. He can help around the house, and he can read Alan's notes."
"Yes, it's decided. Let him live with Milena. Thank you for your help."
"For now, Jacques can live in Alan's house. I will ask Milena, Alan's wife, to shelter the boy for a while."
"And as soon as Alan returns, Jacques will become his student. That will solve everything. Yes, Jacques? Thank you for taking part in this boy's destiny. This was a noble action."
"I didn't think of that. But Jacques is really capable, and if I help him a little, he will succeed! Great idea! Will Jacques agree?"
"Yes, I see, he nods in agreement. So you want to work with me boy? Good. Then let him wait for me at the company building. We will arrange everything in the evening."
Out!
"Oh, you mean how I put that mediocre, prideful girl in her place? Ha! I've been brewing potions since before she was born. Anyone here can tell you."
"But it doesn't hurt to teach this ash-skin a lesson. The Guild won't help her, so I will teach her to respect my work!"
"And, here's how. Alves Uvenim is a cat-hater, she has a terrible allergy to cats. All Dunmer are strange in some way, this one sneezes from cats."
"I'll make it so cats are attracted to the guild. Oh, yes! So I will!"
What are you talking about? There was no conflict. Nothing happened!
"And who are you? Are you Saint Alessia herself? No? Ah, you must be Pelinal Bull-lover. No?"
I'm cruel? While dozens of poor people have died because this red-eye and her beloved guild are asking outrageous prices for their potions?
"Did you know that two decades ago, I wasn't able to save a boy with a complicated fracture, because his father had been unable to buy a restoration potion?"
"The boy died from tissue inflammation. And I couldn't do anything, because it was too late."
I can't brew such strong potions - I don't have the alchemy equipment like Uvenim does. And there are so many expensive ingredients.
And there are dozens of such cases. Yet you say I'm cruel.
"What about the Guild? The guild makes money. Do you think they grow gold in retorts? No, like everyone else, they earn money. Just more than others."
The Mages Guild will never sell their potions cheaply. And they will never give permission for me to trade at the same prices.
"But then, no one will buy my potions and elixirs if they're so expensive. Who do I sell to? The poor. The Khajiit, the Argonians. Yes, everyone who lives in this area."
"Although some potions only I prepare for the rich. You understand, right? Ha! Only I know how to, and no upstart from the Guild can!"
"What do the authorities care about the sick Khajiit or those like Betto Plotius? They are a beggar rabble. They have nothing, no money, no expensive property."
"They pay taxes - and that's all the authorities care about. Well, I treat them. Yes, the Primate still tries to help sometimes. Zenithar himself ordered him to."
Help? Do you want to help me? No need. I can handle it myself. Although...
Here's a bottle with a pair of mixed herbs that cats love. Can you spill it outside the Mages Guild? Subtly. Nobody will think ill of you.
"Fear not, I know how to remove allergies from a Dunmer. So she'll get sick for a couple of days and come running to me. And then I'll get her back. I will request a license."
"I will pass certification in the guild and then I will be able to sell my goods legally. I will not raise the price, but the guild will no longer be able to interfere with me."
"Divide the market, hehe. To me - poor people and visiting people, To the guild - rich people and merchants from Trans-Niben. Well, will you do it?"
"Then here's the bottle. Spill it - come back, and I'll give you another, a neutraliser. Go, I'll prepare the second bottle now."
"Did your knees tremble? Yes, it's scary to argue with the Mages Guild. Well, think. If you think about it enough, you will come back."
This is outrageous! Who came up with such a terrible joke? A dozen cats screaming all night under our windows and preventing us from sleeping! It's atrocious!
"Poor little creatures. My child, they screamed so much under my window that I could even understand their cry. They want to be one with this world!"
Their ringing voices are like bells in a dark empty hall! So bright! So alive! So loud! But I can't hear anything else at all because of their crying.
We must give comfort to these lovely creatures. And quickly!
I think someone was very angry with us. But who could it be? I cannot imagine! And poor Uvenim!
Those creatures were impossible to drive away! I didn't get any sleep. Feed them to Harrada!
This is... ugh! It's foul! What do I smell spilled outside?
"I can't work, but I have a request. Kha... Kha-kha-kha. What a bitch... It's Kha! It's Carmina! She knew. And I... kha-kha-kha..."
Go away! I can't foc... Kha-kha-kha!
"Whatever it was, S'drassa knows how to help. But I cannot help without this root. I do not have the root. None of us does."
I know for sure that Carmina in the Khajiit quarter has the root. I must tell Agata to buy some.
"If I see the beast who decided to make fun of poor Alves... The girl hid all night in the closet. Tell me, was it Carmina?"
"I hear you, child. What do you want to tell me? About cats? They are so sweet, so delicious. But I haven't seen them for a long time. But no..."
"Quite recently, I heard their voices under my window. Did I really? It seems that someone brought cats to us? That was nice. But why would they do such a thing?"
"Old rat! If Dagail had not defended her, we would have dealt with her worthless brews and her backbiting long ago!"
Why did she do it? What did Alves ever do to her?
"Competition. Well, go and tell this half-educated person that the Mages Guild will now make every effort to force Carmina the Herbalist out of this city!"
What are you talking about? Carmina and Alves Uvenim? Ha ha ha ... Carmina is an old friend of mine and she has been practicing alchemy for so long that I can't even remember.
"Alves is a smart girl, fresh, still a child, gifted with talents. But Carmina is much more experienced and older. Competition is so funny! ha ha ha!"
Of course I remember there was some story about Carmina. One time she didn't mix the ingredients quite right and her friend died. Or left? I don't remember.
"Yes... I think I can even hear Vanus cursing back then. But what do you want from me, child?"
"What? What does that have to do with anything? We didn't interfere with her business. Yes, we advised people to be careful with her potions, but..."
"I understand. Yes, I heard Alves say that Carmina's potions are harmful to everyone except Carmina herself."
But for Carmina to do this is too cruel. She knew that Alves was allergic. And what should we do now? Alves cannot work.
Can Carmina cure Alves? Let us see. But I hope she doesn't think the Mages Guild will start promoting Carmina's merchandise?
Why would she want that? Those to whom she sells her herbal teas often don't know how to read. Why would they care if she is licensed? Carmina will have to pass certification at the Guild.
"Only then can we confirm the quality of her brews, potions, tinctures, and ointments. There's no other way. And even then, only if Dagail will allow it."
"Carmina wants a license? Doesn't she have one? That is surprising. All right, Agata will write one, I will ask her. Just tell Carmina to come here."
"Let her come to me and we will remember our walks along Elden Root. And how we... Oh, I completely forgot. Tell Carmina that I'll go to her instead."
Vanus banned her from entering the Guild. Or has he already forgiven her. I vaguely see it.
"Good. I'll go and calm Alves, and you talk to Dagail. If she agrees... if she even hears you, then we may agree."
"Vanus Gallerion. Such a handsome man. So strong. So charming. Ah, when Carmina and I were young girls... I sometimes hear his voice..."
"But you go, child. Let Carmina give medicine to Alves. And everything will be fine, yes? Do you hear? Go on."
You say Agata was furious? Good. At least for a moment they will cease to appear so grand and patronising. So what did they decide?
"A-ha-ha-ha! She won't remember what the alchemical instruments were called! Or will Agata do all the work, and Dagail will smile and nod?"
"But, what's the difference. S'drassa won't come here, he has no time, and the rest understand alchemy no better than a scamp."
"Here, take it. This is the medicine. Take it to Alves Uvenim. But only give it to her if she apologises! Do you hear? Let her know the truth about herself!"
"And pour this under the door, like the previous bottle. This one will scare off cats. Clear? Then get down to business. Oh, I will enjoy their glum faces during the certification!"
"I didn't start it. Petty girl. Fine! Give her the medicine whatever she says. Maybe in a hundred years, an intelligent alchemist will emerge from it."
Go before I change my mind. I still have a cough broth.
Allergy medicine? (sighs) We still have a lot to learn about diseases and their cures. I will tell Dagail that Carmina gave us the medicine.
"I have prepared papers for certification. And... I spoke to Alves Uvenim. From this day on, the Mages Guild will not comment on Carmina's activities without legitimate reasons."
Perhaps Alves really should have been more respectful of Carmina's age and knowledge. Thank you for your help on behalf of the Mages Guild.
"You should find Tsavi, Leyawiin's castle mage. She intends to inform the Count of Carmina's actions."
"You must hurry, otherwise the count may give the order to expel Carmina from the city."
"Yes? This is good to hear. The count still doesn't know anything about the conflict, and now he won't need to know. But Carmina should be ashamed."
"Tsavi will not say anything to Count Marius and his wife, Countess Alessia. But don't let Carmina use her cat potion anymore. The cats are not to blame."
"What could Tsavi do! I cured the Countess of ghe... of a cold. A severe cold. Well, let it be. I am satisfied."
"A boy from the guild came running and said that Dagail and Agata would come tomorrow and even Alves Uvenim would attend, so I need to clean up."
"Here. Take this, it is from my old stock. It should be without side effects. Or not... Haha! just kidding. Now, go, I'm busy."
"That's right. All according to the inventory, everything is as it should be. Cuirass of the White Stallion, one. Brand new. Made by order of Count Marius."
"Helm of the White Stallion, one. Also new. Made by order of Count Marius."
Greaves of the White Stallion.
"What? Ah. Yes, also new, one piece. Here, take it. So, what else is there? Boots of the White Stallion. A pair. Um..."
"Be proud, sir knight. I wore these boots myself... Oh, no, they will be too small. Then take new ones. A pair."
Gauntlets of the White Stallion. A pair. New. The kit is assembled. What did I say that's so funny?
"That's right! This is not a market, this is the Armory. Now where was I? Right. Accounting and control. You are supposed to get one set - if you would please take it."
"And there is nothing funny about it, you know. Knights are supposed to have a Cuirass of the White Stallion, one piece..."
"Then go, sir knight. Perform feats for the glory of the Order and do not forget to take care of the serviceability and cleanliness of your armor and weapons."
"Oh, yes. Some residents of the city wish to honor you for helping the people of Leyawiin. What do you say?"
"I have received a petition to grant you the title of Honored Citizen. It is very, very virtuous and very beneficial!"
"I want to take the petition to Count Marius, but... there are some requirements for a person to receive this title. This can be a difficult, lengthy process."
"If you can get recommendations from influential people in Leyawiin... perhaps, this will prove that you meet those requirements."
"Reach out to families of respected and influential citizens. For example, Gallenus and Valerius. Request recommendations from the Primate and from the Mages Guild."
It will look very good if you get a recommendation from the Imperial Legion. That will make a big impression.
These five recommendations would suffice. Find me after you get them. Good luck.
"A recommendation? From me? But why me? Oh no, no. Not now. I'm busy... I... I can't!"
"A recommendation? From me? Of course I will. Oh, you helped me so much with those damn scamps! Here, take my recommendation."
"Thank you, thank you again. It was terrible!"
"A recommendation? Now? Ah, let's finish dealing with the scamps, first. Then I'll do anything you need."
"Legion recommendation? Um... I don't know, I don't know. Of course I heard your name, but... I don't remember seeing it in the reports. I'll think about it for now."
"Yes, of course. S'drassa told me about your help with Garridan's Tears. The Leyawiin Mages Guild will undoubtedly give you a recommendation."
We hope that the honored citizen of Leyawiin will be able to draw the authorities' attention to the needs and problems of the Mages Guild.
"The Mages Guild will make no such recommendation, until you earn respect in the Leyawiin Mages Guild branch."
"If any of the other members of our branch of the Guild tell me anything about your help or services to the Guild, then I will immediately give you the necessary recommendations. But not before."
"Yes, I remember you helped Dagail with her father's amulet, but in return the Guild gave you a recommendation to the University."
"I think it would be helpful if you talk to the other members of our branch. Perhaps they need help too? For example, S'drassa."
"Oh, no doubt our Guild branch will be honored to provide any recommendation to our Arch-Mage! Anything else, Arch-Mage?"
"This is a good idea. Yes, I will give you the recommendation you need. It is only right."
What? After everything that's happened? Get out of my sight!
Why would I do this? You are nobody to me.
The Champion of Cyrodiil! Of course I will give any recommendation you need. Honored Citizen? Oh! This is a very good idea.
"Hopefully, the adoption by the Champion of Cyrodiil of the title of Honored Citizen of Leyawiin will serve to strengthen the ties between the county and the Imperial City."
This is an undoubted benefit in the eyes of the gods.
"A recommendation? Oh, yes. That's a good idea. You have a great future and Zenithar is pleased with you. I agree to the recommendation."
"The Legion remembers your help with those outlaws and skooma merchants. Yes, you have earned our respect."
"On behalf of the Imperial Legion, I give you a recommendation."
"This is good, very good. Now I can arrange everything. Although some people who signed the petition say that these should not have been necessary."
Give me the recommendations and come back tomorrow.
All is prepared. You should see the count now. Count Marius will host the awards ceremony. Go to him.
"Thank you. I and Olivia both thank you. Soon she, too, will be able to speak freely. But now you have to work hard if you really want to help."
"I can create a phylactery from an ancient ancestral amulet, into which I will place Olivia's spirit so I can safely take her away from here."
"It's not a problem to create a phylactery, but something keeps her spirit here in the city. I can't do anything until we figure out what is holding Olivia here."
"Ask Dagail for advice. It's risky letting another person know the truth, but she already knows a lot about us and our fate. I have never seen such a powerful mystic."
"Help Elendar create a phylactery for Olivia? Ah, child... We are so reckless when we fall in love. And then we look back and are horrified."
"I will help them. Maybe my youth was not so perfect... Ah, the past... Why would you listen to old Dagail. These are my voices..."
"And you need to hear Olivia's voice. In several places, the memory has not faded away even after death. Emotions, strong, bright, long... Feelings..."
They do not release us until death. And even after death. Collect them.
Everything is ready. Take these memory Stones. Let Olivia's spirit guide you to her past. But don't really believe what you see.
"Each of us remembers our life differently from those around us. We see this way, others - that way... You will see only what poor Olivia wants to see."
"You should enter the memories. Not completely, for you will only be able to observe."
"As soon as Olivia names the first place, go there and see what you can see. Memories can be bright, strong, or they can only be voices in your head."
Observe and listen in each memory to learn new locations from the poor girl. And then the Memory Stones will fill.
"I hope you can help her ethereal spirit hear the voices of the past again... Go on, child. They are waiting for you."
"Bring me five pieces of Daedra Silk and five Greater Soul Gems, empty. I will make Memory Stones for you."
"Just hurry up, foolish child... Strong feelings constrain the mind, but the mind of the spirit is weak, and the emotions are strong."
"If you fail to do this, Olivia's spirit will forever remain attached to Leyawiin. And, listen... You shouldn't tell anyone about my help."
Go. And remember what I said.
"Yes, all that is needed. Come back in two days. I should be finished by then."
My memories? Is my memory holding me back? But how can I live without memory? Without what is dear to me... It is incomprehensible and frightens me.
Oh... Tsavi didn't think it would go this far. This is bad. Very bad. This shouldn't have happened. Poor Olivia.
We were all terrified after the incident at the cemetery. But Elendar wanted to understand what it was. Tsavi discouraged them. She said something bad would happen.
"But is anyone listening to Tsavi? Olivia asked to visit the Invel House. There is a hatch there, behind the door. A secret vault. Invels don't talk about it."
"But Tsavi knows, she helped them put up protection spells from damp and rats. Nothing special. Just storage space. Nothing illegal. A little secret. Just like others have."
"And then they began to say that the Invels were hiding a monster there. It wasn't even a rumor. Fairy tales. Everyone was laughing; Valerius, even Tsavi. What monster?"
But Olivia went and she felt bad. They said that it was stifling. Yes. But Olivia was afraid. And she began to hurt. A little at first. Then more. Yes.
"Tsavi doesn't know the details. And then Olivia died. All true. Did you need to hear this? Here, Tsavi said everything."
Did you do it? I'm surprised. But we must hurry. Olivia hasn't shown up for some time. She's getting weak. The memories tired her.
"Give me the stones and I'll start the ritual. As soon as everything is ready, I will conduct the ritual and then we will leave. There is nothing left for me here."
I will send you a letter once we are away. We will not forget your help.
"Do you think that the memory will stay with me with the help of these stones? I don't understand, but I will trust you. Elendar promised you could be trusted. So be it. I'm ready."
"First... What was there... Bright light, incense... Light. Yes I know. My wedding! Zenithar Chapel! Me and Manius. So beautiful... so exciting!"
"It was so beautiful. Guests, music, my beloved so near, and then I became his wife... so... perfect. We didn't have any worries back then..."
"Ah, my Manius..."
It's hard for me to say... I feel so weak. I don't remember... Just a trapdoor in a house... and candles. A room... Music. Scary... It seemed for a moment...
It's dark. There is a monster... And I... I can't remember. Do what you must! Quickly!!!
"Glory to Talos. This nightmare will finally end. Thank you. However, I can't lie. I have no desire to see you again. Is this clear?"
"But for the sake of Olivia and my daughters, I'm going to pretend it's okay. And I ask you to do the same."
And for the sake of all the gods there are in this world - keep your mouth shut. Here. This is all that I could collect. I hope that's enough?
"However, I have no more. I... I need to be alone."
"Ah, Olivia, poor child, unable to find the long-awaited peace. But you have that ring that allowed you to talk to Olivia?"
"Yes, you do have it. That's the solution. We tied Olivia's spirit to this ring. Put the ring in Olivia's sarcophagus."
The girl will think that whatever holds her here is resolved and her spirit will leave us. Manius will give you the key to the mausoleum and you can put Olivia's Spirit Ring there.
"I rarely have to say this, but I don't know what to do... You see... it seems to me that Olivia is not independent."
"Behind her crying and moaning, someone else's voice sounds. Strong, domineering, unkind. It blocks the way. It takes away her will... There is darkness, powerful darkness."
"Here is the damn key. Do whatever needs to be done, just do it quickly. My daughters can no longer show themselves in the city - everyone stares and whispers!"
"I don't know, child... But it seems to me that it is one of the Daedra. Not the lowest, no, one of the powerful, one of the lords."
But I can't understand... So much power! I am lost in the strength of this power. Poor Olivia!
"You must go to Chorrol. There, in the Chorrol Mages Guild, my longtime acquaintance, Alberic Litte, works."
The Chorrol Mages Guild specialises in Conjuration. Ask Alberic what to do. He has to help.
"You must find out which of the Daedric Princes could establish their power over the spirit of Olivia Valerius. Fortunately, Daedric Princes are not all-powerful."
"If a person never turned to them during his lifetime, then even after death the gods will not allow his soul to become dependent on the Daedra."
"Although, of course, there are exceptions... But typically, not being associated with the Daedra will prevent you from falling into their clutches."
"You must find out which of the Princes could participate in the fate of Olivia. Perhaps she turned to any of them, visited their sanctuaries? Made offerings?"
If you find out anything - come to me and I will try to find a solution to the problem.
Live. I wanted to live! Didn't you understand? Didn't we explain? He loved me! And I WANTED TO LIVE!
"Get out! Get out! You are killers, all of you! Revenge! I'll take revenge on all of you. Everyone!"
"Yes, what you are describing is similar to the known cases of submission to the highest Daedra, to Sheogorath or Vermina. It happens."
Sometimes Daedric Princes use spirits and ghosts for their own purposes. Especially if the spirit is still active and does not seek to leave Nirn.
"If the spirit of this unfortunate woman fell under the power of a Daedric Prince, it will be very difficult to help her. Very difficult. Almost impossible."
"Nocturnal? Lady of the Night? Of course! After all, her shrine is near to Leyawiin!"
"I think I can help. Wait, let me think... Nocturnal, Nocturnal... I had something about Nocturnal and her cult."
"There was something about the night birds, ravens and crows. Ah!"
There is a book. [QUOTE]The Path of the Ancestor Crow[QUOTE]. It is very old and was written by some of the highest members of the cult. A very powerful artifact.
"This story is horrible, you need to help the poor woman. It's strange that my daughter, Countess Alessia in Leyawiin, didn't tell me anything about Olivia's spirit."
"But what is required of me? I'm not a mage, perhaps it would be wiser to contact the Mages Guild?"
The little girl who was so afraid of the dark. I remember her. Such sweet fears. I sent the most amusing shadows I could find to her.
"She was so bravely afraid! Ha ha ha! Each time, my shadows carried away a piece of her fear. A tidbit. They still love her."
"And when the girl fell asleep, my crows admired her dreams. A strong girl. And soon she will come to me forever."
"A Daedric Prince? Save us, Talos! My wife would never... No, wait."
"She said that her mother used to take her to the shrine. And then, when we moved here to Leyawiin, she visited the shrine herself. It is not far from here."
"As always, I didn't even listen to what she was saying... she would visit the shrine sometimes, she took flowers and pearls... And something else. I don't know."
"Something to do with the darkness of the night. She seemed to be afraid of the dark. Or was it the opposite, she loved when it was getting dark. Several times she walked at night, with guards, of course."
"Oh? Yes, it sounds like Nocturnal. Most likely it is. I cannot say for sure. Are there other shrines nearby? That's all I know."
"And I don't want to know, do you hear? Deliver me from all this, finally!"
"Yes, exactly. Speak to Countess Valga, she definitely has the book. But promise me that you will tell me later whether this book helped you?"
"In the end, this is an invaluable experience of communicating with such entities. Oh, I almost forgot! Please convey my best wishes to Countess Arriana!"
"If my memory serves me, then the book should be in the library of Chorrol Castle. You should speak to the countess."
"Few people know about this book. Yes, I have it, and I will, of course, give you the book if it will help with this ghost in Leyawiin."
"But did you know that not everyone can use the book? In order to use this book properly, you need another artifact belonging to Nocturnal."
To unlock the power of the book you must have the Skeleton Key - a gift from the Lady of the Night herself.
Yes? Perhaps I should be glad that there are such brave and determined defenders of order and tranquility in Leyawiin.
One way or another - no one will say that Arriana Valga refused to help a respectable family in trouble. I've heard of the Valerius family.
This is the book. You have to be extremely careful with it. I would take this book to the Mages Guild and try to read it only when there. Under reliable protection.
But it's up to you. Blessings of Stendarr upon you.
"Are you asking for mercy from me? Do I look like a stupid old woman who gives freely, without thought?"
"Evergloam gives rest to the souls of mortals. They serve me as voices, shadows, wings. Isn't that a mercy?"
But the little girl deserves a reward. She did not forget the Lady of the Night. I'll give you a choice. You and her.
"You will leave here, without my gift - the Skeleton Key. Then the girl will also have a choice. If you keep the key, then she will not have a choice."
"I will keep the Key so that Olivia can choose her fate. She may come to me, in Evergloam, and become my servant forever."
"Or she may choose peace and her soul will merge with Aetherius. But first, you must make your choice. Decide."
"How noble. Hmm... So be it. I'll give you the Night Wrath spell. If Olivia doesn't want to come to me, use it. And she will be free."
Now go.
I had no doubts. Just an ordinary mortal. Get out.
"Nocturnal remembers me? And will she grant me service in Evergloam, at her feet? How can I, a restless spirit devoid of a future, disagree?"
"You killed the one who loved me and promised me a life. The one who spoke about love killed him, but could not cope with gossip and whispers behind his back. Let it be."
"I go to the Lady who was kind to me in my youth, and shows mercy now. So be it. I agree."
"I must tell my daughters that it is finally over... We are tired. I'm grateful to you, but... I don't want to see you anytime soon. We need to rest."
Here are 200 septims. This is all I can give. I hope you understand.
"How dare you! Get away, you beast!"
"Thank you for the information, this was unknown to me. I will immediately report it to the count and we will take action."
What? No one reported this to me. I will order the guards to deal with this matter.
I'm busy!
A ghost? I don't know anything about a ghost. Leave me alone.
I don't know anything about any ghost. I'm busy.
"I don't know anything about this, citizen."
"This one does not know. No, this one does not know anything."
A ghost? I forget it's a cemetery when I walk through. Ask someone else.
Gods! A ghost in the graveyard? What is the Primate doing about this? And why did the caretaker not report it to anyone? I must tell the count.
"Ghosts? What, wandering about? Ridiculous! You're totally crazy! In my time, such talk wouldn't be tolerated! Back when I was a guard."
"A ghost? No, this one cannot say anything... No, it cannot. This one doesn't want to talk."
(Remains silent)
"Oh. Okay. Tsavi knows, yes. It has to end sometime, right?"
"No. No, Tsavi doesn't know. Will not speak. No."
"Olivia. Olivia Valerius. But this one didn't tell you anything, okay? Poor thing! Her soul did not find peace. Tsavi doesn't know why."
"But Tsavi really wants to know why Olivia became a ghost. You want to know too, right?"
"Ask Elendar. The caretaker at the cemetery. He knows. And he can help, yes. He will help you talk to Olivia. Give him this note and he will help you."
Elendar the mage. He is very experienced and very smart. But he doesn't want to be with the Mages Guild. He wants not to be disturbed.
"Olivia, Tsavi and Elendar were friends, while Olivia was alive. And now Elendar doesn't want to see anyone. But he knows something."
Talk to him. Try it.
Then why are you asking? Why do you meddle in other people's business? Go away.
What are you talking about? Olivia spoke to you? How is this possible? What nonsense! I don't want to listen to this nonsense!
I don't know anything. We are forbidden to talk to strangers. Go away! I don't know you!
"Oh, how sad it is. Olivia's papers were burned. But not all, no. Tsavi took Olivia's diary. Not because there is something needed there. For the memory."
Take the diary. Should you give it to Olivia? Maybe this is correct? Tsavi thinks so.
Olivia will see the diary and then... remember? Or say something? We must try.
"Yes, I knew Olivia. Tell me what you want, exactly."
"Yes, I knew Olivia. We were very close, friends since childhood. I cried so much when I found out that Olivia was dead. I really miss her."
"So you will help us? Then we will succeed. Trust me, I will find a way to thank you! Tell Manius Valerius that I will put Olivia to rest."
Let him not worry about her fate. I'll send you a letter with instructions on what to do. Olivia will remain at my house for now.
"Who are you? Who are you, daedroth devour you, that you consider yourself entitled to meddle in our affairs? Go away! I don't want to talk to you! Go away!"
"By the gods, how did you manage it? Tsavi didn't tell anyone anything, but this is her handwriting, alright."
So what do you want? Olivia is dead. Why do you care about this?
Mother Azura. Did Elendar tell you everything? Then Tsavi doesn't know what else to do. Olivia's letters are all Tsavi has.
"Letters are private and cannot be given. Therefore Tsavi will burn them. Ask her husband for something of Olivia's, yes. Who else would have such things."
What do you care about my late wife? Get out. And don't you dare approach me any more!
"Do I know you? Why should I talk to you about my mother? Leave, or I'll call for help!"
Oh! I don't know you. Go away! Leave me alone.
I... I don't know anything. I don't know anything!
"Well, I don't know anything. What do you want of me? What do you need to know of Olivia? I'm not her daughter, I know little."
"So first tell me something good about Gunnar, and I will answer you kindly."
"Did she say that she loved him? Fine. I had hoped to give her a little peace in my house. But if this is so, then I need not interfere anymore."
Let everything be as it will be. I will not help you.
"You won't be silent if I just kick you out, will you? I know your kind... Like hungry scamps, you flock to someone else's trouble."
What do you want? Glory? Money? Influence? And poor Tsavi believed you...
"But what to tell? At first, as she and the cat, the mage, began to meet, everything seemed to be fine. She was so cheerful, everyone was busy."
"And then, when this cemetery ghoul appeared, everything went wrong. Lady Olivia ran to him, and they climbed into graves together."
"What a passion - to stir up old bones. This is not good. That's what I told her, my lady, then. I told her, it's not good, the gods will punish you. And she just laughed."
"Well, it happened as I said. They poisoned her, our lady, Olivia. She sat there, reading the letter. Then how she screamed!"
"It happened fast just like fish in a frying pan. In such agony and pain, she screamed so that I could hear it in the kitchen."
"Help? What?! But, okay, I'll tell you. Olivia and I were friends, along with Tsavi. Olivia was a smart woman with a soldier husband."
"Daughters grown up, the house clean and tidy. She was bored. She spent her days in the castle library."
She became friends with Tsavi. And then I met her while researching in the library. She was interested in my research on restless spirits. There are a lot of them in the cemetery.
Manius? He was happy as long as his wife had something to occupy her. Gave her small sums for her entertainment.
So the husband was happy with everything. The wife is busy. The house is in order. And he can boast of a smart wife on occasion.
Manius was completely unaware of anything.
"The fact that I was interested in Olivia. She was beautiful and smart, and I am not yet old. We were constantly close in the tombs. She rekindled my fire."
"At first, I just took fancy to her, and then it was as if I saw her anew - cheerful, laughing, beautiful... She looked younger and more alive."
"I even wrote a letter to send to my relatives on Auridon. I asked for consent to marriage. Praise Auriel, I never sent it."
"Olivia didn't notice. Or pretended not to notice. Tsavi immediately understood and withdrew. She rebuked me, but did not interfere."
I gave Olivia gifts several times. I tried to hint. Get closer. But she never realised.
Then I figured out how to tell her. I wrote a diary with declarations of love and left it in a prominent place.
"Yes. And she told her husband. Manius kicked her out of the house, so Olivia came to me. In the evening of 13 Second Seed. I remember the day. We talked."
"I sent Olivia home. Otherwise, I would have to drop everything and return to Auridon. All my work would be for nothing. Manius could have destroyed us."
Olivia was offended. Several times I wrote to her through Tsavi. She didn't answer. And then Olivia was gone. She was killed.
"Yes. Poisoned. I am a mystic and a... a necromancer. I feel the souls of intelligent creatures. I hear them. Not like Dagail, but I can do a lot too."
"Olivia was dying in terror, pain and fear. It took a long time. She did not understand and suffered. And I felt it all. Every moment of her terror and despair."
I want revenge! Since you know everything - will you help me?
We need to get Olivia's spirit to speak. I tried but couldn't communicate. I don't know why Olivia stayed and didn't go to Aetherius.
"If we find out, we can help Olivia. And take revenge on her killers. The most important thing is for Olivia to speak."
You will have to get some of her personal belongings. Jewelry or something. The things Olivia will remember.
Then we can return the voice to Olivia's spirit.
"What? What sorcery are you up to? You'll conjure something up! And then, I'll see everyone running around scared. Oh you mustn't!"
"Why do you need her things? I will always thank you for Gunnar, but I'm afraid about what you'll do with a dead person's things."
I have nothing. The master collected everything and locked them away. He gave the dresses and all that feminine stuff to the young ladies or threw them away.
"You should ask Borgunna. I served the young ladies, Borgunna was more the mistress's maid."
"The mistress often gave her small trinkets. Cheap rings, handkerchiefs, brooches. Of course it's like giving to imps. Borgunna is so wild."
She sold almost everything at once or sent them to her relatives. She didn't even save for her dowry. She said that her boyfriend would take her anyway if he loved her.
She has such a healthy boyfriend! But he's so rude! I once...
"Hold on. First, you help me, and then you can ask for something in return. You seek my help, but aren't you a well-doer? So you help me first. Can you help?"
"It's a good thing to calm the spirit. You help Lady Olivia, then. Okay. You helped me, I help you. Here, a ring. My mistress gave it to me just before she died."
"From the wedding, she said. She wore it, she never took it off her finger until she gave it to me. Good luck to you..."
So now you use the ring and return it. Such memories of Lady Olivia. Go on. I have to go now.
"I'm so sorry, but I really don't know anything. Borgunna spent half her day on tasks for Lady Olivia. You must ask her! She will definitely help."
Okay? Now I have to run!
"Olivia Valerius. Poor girl. I wish I could help her, but my amulet is gone. And until it is returned to me, I can do nothing, my child."
"Olivia Valerius. Poor girl. Of course, I'll help you. Olivia's misery sounds like an alarm bell over all Leyawiin."
"I can hear it clearly now. Her suffering soul must be comforted and sent to Aetherius. Is that not right, child? But how exactly can I help you?"
"Okay then. You help me, I will help you. Like good people do. Well, listen."
"Well, you can go to oblivion!"
"You know who! That yellow elf, from the cemetery, he poisoned her. Who else? Only him! You see, they found something valuable in the crypts which he wanted for himself."
"Oh, well, I don't know. It is forbidden! The young ladies will be very unhappy, if they know. And the master will surely kick me out. I will be left completely without funds."
"Young girls need to take care of themselves, which is so expensive."
"Shhh! Put it discreetly in my pocket. Oh, I'm so glad! Oh! Well I... Earrings. I will buy myself earrings! Aye! Well, say what you want!"
As always. Make a promise and leave. Like all the men I ever met.
"It's complicated. A spirit remaining in Nirn may not speak to the living. All but the strongest feelings fade, and the remaining force is very weak."
"To start a conversation, a spirit needs to gather all its strength and focus on the feelings that did not allow it to go to Aetherius."
"But what feelings did Olivia's spirit retain? Hatred? No, her voice is filled with pain and sorrow, but there is no hatred in it. So what happened to the girl?"
"Her ring? Good. But I can't do it, I don't know how. We need help from Dagail of the Mages Guild."
"Go to her, only, for the sake of all gods, do not tell her more than necessary. She is old, but not at all stupid and has not lost her mind."
Try to appeal to her skill. I hope she agrees to help. Hurry up.
"Oh, it's you. Do you need Olivia's ring? I didn't sleep last night. I had to listen and hear."
"The river of time is unforgiving, but woe to those whom it threw in the shallows. However, you are not interested in this, are you, child?"
Take the ring and speak to Olivia's spirit by putting the ring on your finger. This is the only way she can hear you and answer you.
"Oh? This is so strange. The spirit is not grieving for death. I do not hear the voices of vengeance. Her suffering is because of something else. Death was only a moment, nothing more."
"Trust me child. Tell the true reason for Olivia Valerius's grief. Otherwise, I cannot help you."
"Love is the cause of many troubles. Many deaths, victories, conquests and defeats. Olivia Valerius grieves for love. But her husband loved her."
I know for sure that Manius Valerius did love Olivia. Ah... I see. This is a different feeling. Love of another. This will be difficult.
"I will try to work on this ring. At night, when everyone is asleep and there is no one to bother me and stop me from hearing Olivia's voice. Come tomorrow, child."
"I remember him. He's a friend. He loved me. He wanted me to be with him. I remember... Elendar helped you? Where is Manius? Where is my husband, my beloved?"
"Was I poisoned? I don't remember. Only the pain here, in the chest. Then darkness. And the voice of Manius. He called for me. But I left him."
"Tell my husband I loved him, I was always faithful to him. That stupid fight... I don't remember why. It was so stupid! I had to leave. It hurt me."
Say that Elendar would not dare. No! Don't say it! My husband will kill him. Do not. Ah... How stupid I was! And this letter!
A letter from a friend. She wrote to me. I read this letter. And then came the pain and darkness. I didn't have time to tell Manius. Will you tell him?
That I love... I loved him... He's not to blame. It's not him. And not Elendar. This is fate. Destiny. Is this destiny? Really? Bring me the answer.
And tell Elendar that I am grateful to him. Now go. It's hard for me to talk. The forces are leaving. I'm getting weak.
Who told you this? My daughters? A servant? Confess! Who knew! Who betrayed me?
Letter? But I didn't write any letter to her at that time. I used to send Olivia letters through the Gold Horse Courier service. I have connections there.
But I wrote my last letter back in the month of the Morning Star. And it was Olivia's turn to write to me next. What's the matter?
"Ida Vlinorman did not write to Olivia? Tsavi doesn't understand. Maybe someone forged the letter? Then we must look for this villain, yes. Find and punish them."
Tsavi should probably tell Manius Valerius. And tell you about the bottle of ointments. Tsavi remembers that bottle. Great smell. For a human.
"Tsavi also wants to say that there is no need to say anything to Elendar. You don't need to say anything. You understand, right?"
"Well, well. So the letter was not from Ida? I remember the case which held the bottle of ointment. So old, made from red leather. I had wondered why the case was needed."
"And I remember the ointment well. The smell was very annoying. Very sweet and so... cloying? However, I'm not an expert on smells."
"Search Elendar's house. Do you hear? Find me proof! I know you will find some, it must be him! There is no one else!"
Then I will destroy him!
What? Why? Why did you decide that I have something to do with the death of someone I loved and still love? What kind of nonsense comes into your head? You and Tsavi?
"I would never harm Olivia. Moreover, she felt ill a few days before her death."
So where did you get the idea that I poisoned my beloved?
"Yes, I have your first task right here. A report has come in from Vienele, and it's quite serious. There is a sickness in the Arboretum; she is trying to find a cure."
"You should assist her in any way she requests, we don't want any deaths. She is staying at the Arboretum Hotel."
"Yes, I have your next task right here. A report has come in from Vienele, and it's quite serious. There is a sickness in the Arboretum; she is trying to find a cure."
"You should assist her in any way she requests, we don't want any deaths. She is staying at the Arboretum Hotel."
"Ah, our new recruit. Yes, there is something you can do for the guild. I ordered some special wood from Argonia, reportedly superior for crafting into bows."
"The delivery should have arrived a few days ago, yet I am still waiting. Head to Leyawiin and visit the offices of the Topal Trading Company in the Southern Docks."
"Speak to Moorswind in Skingrad, I believe he has a task for you."
"Go to Chorrol, Lihandril sent word that she needs an Apprentice for a task."
"I'm sorry, I have no tasks for a member of your rank. Head to Lihandril in Chorrol or Moorswind in Skingrad if you want a task."
We do require your assistance in a most important matter.
"Our guild is quite young compared to the Fighters Guild and the Mages Guild, and to be really efficient we need to expand with new recruits."
We have gathered a list of potential candidates and would like you to go to them and ask them to join our ranks.
I have had news from our guild branch in Leyawiin. You should see Falwin there. I think he may have a task for you.
"Ah Journeyman. It is good that you have come. Our guildmaster wants to speak with you personally, she has a task for you."
Normally you wouldn't have met her but she says it is important that she speaks to you face to face. This is highly irregular...
"Guildmaster Silverneck said not to pass any menial tasks on to someone with your skills, so presently I have nothing for you. But since you're here, could you speak with Glassclaw? I think there's something upsetting him."
Ah yes. Culumani of our new Anvil branch wants to talk to you.
"Ah my good friend, indeed I was hoping you would visit. I wanted to thank you for this lovely home you secured for us. I heard the Countess asked you for some unusual task to allow us to settle here."
"Dagail, Tsavi, Elendar. The whole gang is assembled. All working together. Such close friends. Do you think I'm blind? I didn't see anything?"
How did that bastard fool my Olivia? Did the cat and the elf steal my money from the pocket of my gullible wife?
"I know that Olivia loved me, even until her death. Even when I got angry and kicked her out of the house. Even then, she loved me. And yet she went to Elendar..."
"She did not go to the castle. She told me about Elendar. And I, the old fool, got jealous. She asked for advice and help - and I kicked her out."
"Thank Talos, the elf did not let her stay. He sent her away, and she returned to me again. Of course I forgave her, she wasn't guilty of anything."
"And then ... When I saw Olivia dead, it was as if I had died myself. Even now ... I'm afraid to go to the cemetery and see her ghost."
"There's nothing to find. I burned all her papers. And her letter too. It was from her friend in the Imperial City, Ida Vlinorman. They were family friends."
Why do you need this letter? What could interest you? Just the usual women's gossip. I read it.
"By letter? What nonsense! I also read this letter. And I am alive, as you can see. Who told you about the poisoning? Olivia? Dagail? You must tell me..."
There was no poison. Why are you digging into all this at all? What do you want from Olivia? Or from our family?
Poisoned? By a letter from me? How is this possible? Who can create such a poison and who can afford it? Certainly not me!
You don't need to drag me into this poisoning case. I would never kill my best friend! I hope you have no more questions?
Now leave me alone! All I can do to help is to pray for Olivia's soul.
"I don't know how to help Olivia. Maybe that cat will help you, Tsavi. She came after the funeral and took Olivia's diary."
"She said that it contained some memories meaningful to her. I gave it to her, so ask Tsavi. If you can calm Olivia's spirit, I'll... I'll be most thankful."
"My diary? Yes, I feel its presence. My memory awakes... Ohhh! So many memories. Why? I don't want to remember all this."
"Take it away, take it away! It is saturated with my pain and poison. I feel bad again. I can't speak anymore... Find Ida. I'm going..."
"It was not ointment. It was a special compound that scares away various undead, ghosts, spirits, and anyone from the undead world."
"Olivia wanted to work with me so I had to protect her. I couldn't find another way. Although the smell is terrible, it's true."
"Please believe me. I love Olivia and am ready to do everything to help her live, even as a spirit. She herself agrees with me. Talk to her, then decide."
"If you help me, I can leave and take Olivia with me. But if you tell Manius everything, Olivia will be put to rest and I will lose her forever."
What scraps? I don't know anything about this. I was not at home for most of the day. Anyone could have planted a piece of paper.
"Listen to me! I love Olivia. And I don't care who killed her or why. I want to save Olivia, give her the opportunity to continue her life in spirit."
"Not a mad and aggressive undead spirit, but a completely rational, self-conscious person. I can do it at home on Auridon. But not here."
"Therefore, I urgently need to take Olivia home before she leaves us. Help me. Help me take Olivia away."
"And then you can do whatever you want. Investigate the poisoning, take revenge, do something else. It won't matter to me anymore. Just help me now."
"Exactly! It's up to you. If in doubt, ask Olivia herself. Let it be as she decides. Holy Auriel! This is her life, after all."
"Talk to Olivia and decide. If you tell Manius, I will soon be another corpse in Leyawiin cemetery. However, all this does not matter."
It's up to you.
"Who chooses death, when you can live? Are darkness and cold better than light and warmth? Even the life that is available to me now is better than nothing."
"I'm ready to leave with Elendar. He loves me, that's enough. Elendar will be able to keep my spirit close to him."
"He's good. Faithful. Reliable. But would he agree to break the chains of laws and prejudices for my sake? No, he's too decent."
But I don't want to go to Aetherius. I'm not ready! Do you hear? Not ready! Remember this when you go to talk to my husband.
Oh? Why do you believe this cemetery rat? Although I don't care anymore. I only want peace for my family.
"Whoever poisoned Olivia, I can't get him, can I? And my wife cannot be returned, so all that remains is to take care of the living."
"Since Elendar decided to do everything himself, so be it. Who else can do this better than the necromancer Altmer? Go. And return to me once it is done."
How dare he! I'll deal with him myself. My sword has drunk the blood of necromancers more than once. And Altmer too.
"This monster seduced my Olivia while she was alive, and wants to take her away from me after death? This will not happen!"
"You have to put the poor ghost to rest, but find a way to do it quickly and painlessly. May she rest in peace. I'll deal with Elendar."
"Yes, it was so scary! It knocked me off my feet and screamed loudly. And then it got scared when my husband went out to look and ran away."
"It seems to me that this is the very creature that has been stealing my strawberries. Every morning some strawberries are missing in my beds. My delicious, sweet berries!"
Tell me you will help me? You'll find out what steals my berries? What scared me so? Will you drive it away?
I think you should watch our vegetable garden after midnight. I think the thief will definitely appear.
"I can't remember much because I was very scared. It squealed so loudly that I still have the noise in my head, really."
"It is small, but very strong and dexterous. It knocked me down and ran away quickly. My evening dress was all marked from its paws."
"His paws were all covered in strawberries! Nasty creature, steals my strawberries. He must be caught and punished properly! My poor berries!"
Oh? My berries are gone.
"What're you talking about? We would not allow goblins to get inside these walls. N'ursa must have spent too long in the tavern, and imagined it."
"Go, citizen, don't bother us. Can't you see, we're on guard. We'll protect you from the goblins!"
"Are you serious? Where does the goblin come from? Or maybe you imagined it, because it was dark."
"Or the brandy in the Khajiit Quarter is too strong for you? Okay, okay, go."
"Right here in the city, a goblin? Well... I'll report it to the captain. But right now I am on duty, I will tell her when I am relieved."
A goblin? Nasty creatures. My cousin in Skingrad says goblins are dangerous creatures. But...
"Without proof, no one will do a thing, as no one will believe that a goblin has appeared in the city. So you go to Carmina in the Khajiit Quarter."
"She's got potions, all kinds of roots, and other ingredients... So you tell her about the goblin. Let her give you some poison."
"As captain of the guard, I can say that this is impossible. But I promise that your report will be investigated, citizen, as soon as I have someone available."
"What, just sent you like that? It seems our guards can do what they like, the countess spoils them. But you're not here to talk about guards. So what do you want from me?"
"All that just for one goblin? Hit him hard, or scare him off with some magic if you know how. A lone goblin is always cowardly and will definitely run away from danger."
"But it's easier to spray one particularly odorous mixture at the hole. Goblins do not like this smell and leave when they smell it. Here, take it."
"You spray it at the entrance to the hole and leave, otherwise you will soak yourself, and you will start to smell badly so that not only the goblin - but we all will have to run away. Got it?"
"It's just goblin magic. Their shamans protect their burial places like that. Here, take this potion. Drink it and become like a goblin."
"Now, don't spill it on your body, you will smell like a lustful... oh, you don't need details. Drink, then you can get into the hole."
"But do not linger in the hole for a long time, otherwise you will really become a goblin. Hee-hee-hee. Yes, I was joking, do not be afraid."
"So? You're not going to see Countess Alessia. Don't drink it now. Wait until you get to the hole. Well, go then."
"Gone? Oh, how good it is that he ran away. Nobody else will eat my berries before I pick them. And my dresses will not be torn. Now I can safely walk to the tavern."
"N'ursa is grateful to you. Here, take these, these are fresh berries from my best garden."
Did the goblin really write poetry? Just think! You should show the book to Janar the Philosopher. Do you know him?
"He sits at his favorite shop in the Khajiit Quarter all day, and he reads and reads everything. N'ursa thinks so much reading is bad."
But you ask him about the book. Maybe it's valuable?
It can't be! Give Janar the book. So... so... so wonderful! It's really poetry.
But where did you find this book? Where is this goblin? It's just incredible. Do you have any idea what such a book means? Janar hopes nothing happened to the author?
But why? A small harmless goblin ate strawberries and wrote poetry. And you only drove him away because N'ursa felt sorry for the berries in the garden.
"Yes, Janar would have paid her for these berries. Eh! You don't understand."
"Of course they are dangerous. They have teeth, claws, and even weapons. Just like us Khajiit. As well as you. After all, you also have a weapon."
But you don't write poetry.
Take this book. Janar hopes that you will not become some paladin of Good and Light. Maybe you won't.
You have come. Perfect. We are grateful to you for helping the city. Go to the port and see with your own eyes what you can do.
The Mages Guild said they have some ideas to share with you. I look forward to your success.
You're here! I always knew that the Knights of the White Stallion could be counted on even in the most difficult situation. Go to the port and see for yourself.
"And then go to the Mages Guild, they have some ideas on how to destroy the bridge."
"Yes, the bridge is a great hindrance. Ships from the Imperial City cannot dock and unload. We urgently need you to remove this blasted bridge."
"Oh, just ask Alves Uvenim, she was doing research on Daedric architecture."
"Remove the bridge? Yes, you can, but ask Alves Uvenim for details."
"We have developed a spell just for this task. It will remove the bridge, along with all traces of the opened gate."
"The problem is that it is very energy intensive, not every mage can boast of the required mana reserves. We decided to transfer the spell to a scroll."
"To create the scroll, we use a special storage device - a varla stone, which will give the required amount of mana."
"In addition to the varla stone, we need three extracts of Daedra venin and three pinches of fire salt to create ink."
And to make the parchment we need three pieces of scamp skin and one sample of Daedra silk. I'll give you a list of what you need.
Good. Come back as soon as you find everything I wrote on the list.
"No? But the city needs ships coming into the port... However, as you decide. If you change your mind, come back."
"Fine. Give them here. We named the spell Litany of Purification. Come back in two days, Dagail will have the scroll."
"Here, take it, child. Stand at the beginning of the bridge, facing the gates, and read the Litany of Purification. The ritual is safe for people."
The litany will send everything the Daedra created back to the Oblivion plane. Maybe the area itself will be restored to its original form.
"Go child, may the blessing of the Nine be with you."
The city thanks you! Here is a modest reward collected by the townspeople especially for you.
Poor. Nobody buys anything. They said that Leyawiin is a rich city and there is always a demand for fabrics. Maybe you want to buy something from me?
"Shame. Come on Sundas then, I have a big sale every Sundas. You will be able to buy at discount or sell for a greater profit."
Why did we come here? I wish I knew.
"We were just making camp on the beach after a successful raid, when the cap received this damn letter, like a madman he had us break camp and sailed the Unicorn to Leyawiin."
"How would I know? Now we just sit here and wait for the cap to find what he is looking for, curse him! I myself want to know what was in the damned letter that so fried his arse!"
"Lebon Dombale has been selling wine for only the third year, but has already managed to gain a reputation in the castle, becoming a supplier of the [QUOTE]Three Sisters[QUOTE] and several wealthy houses."
"They say he has his own team looking for rare wines for the Dombale collection. The rest, he sells."
A talented young man. I think he will soon become an honored citizen of Leyawiin.
"By the grace of Zenithar and the will of the Nine, this outrageous story has ended. Olivia is at rest and we held a prayer service at the request of Manius."
An investigation should be started as to why the Mages Guild and the honorable Dagail overlooked a vile necromancer under their noses.
"This whole story with ghosts and sorcerers in love is not worth a damn. A man needs to look after his wife, and not look at the skirts of the townspeople!"
"He married a young woman, but someone runs away with his wife. Am I right? Ha ha ha!"
"And where was the captain of the guard looking? I said that there is no place for a woman to lead the guards, but who listens to me. Same skirts all around..."
"I often see members of the Fighters Guild in the Leyawiin taverns. Disgusting sight. Violent, uncontrollable, completely unable to drink or fight."
"If not for the glorious past of the Guild, I would have raised the question of closing the branch in Leyawiin long ago. The Blackwood Company is much better."
There is both discipline and combat training. And they make donations to Zenithar with enviable regularity.
"Yesterday I went to the market to see what's new, and bought a couple of bottles of very good wine in Lebon Dombale's stall."
"He has a great selection of wines. I've even seen a few rare varieties. See, go for a walk, and you don't know what you might find."
I can hear what they say behind my back. It's simple - I stop them from praying to their old gods they brought here from Elsweyr and Black Marsh.
"Let them talk. Let them laugh. Soon everything will change. The apostates have already shown their faces. The emperor is slain, is that not enough for them?"
"What else needs to happen for them to come to the chapel and finally pray to the Nine? Fortunately, I have allies. The countess, her counselor."
There is someone to put things in order in this city!
"I hate beggars! If there's no work in the city - go to the port. There is always work to do. But no! They stay and beg! And, they will spit at you, if you don't give some coins."
Have they ever tried to work instead of begging! For many years I have been saying that all beggars should be sent to public works.
"Let them clean up the canal. Or expand the port. Yes, even to help Elendar in the cemetery. As assistants, or whatever he wanted workers for there."
Nobody takes me on a ship. They say I stink and I'm weak. In the evening they might pour me a mug. Or they might beat me.
"Recently, the crew from the Unicorn were getting drunk in the Safe Harbor. They knocked out my tooth. Their captain is angry, and he is looking for something. I don't know what."
"He goes to the tavern and sits, waiting for something. But what is he waiting for?"
Why am I being blamed for this rumor about Elendar? Should I chase every ghost? They would do better to look after their own families.
Now let the mages figure out who conjured this ghost. What does the Primate of Zenithar have to do with it? What matters is that donations are made on time.
Do you know that we have a connoisseur and collector of rare wines in our city? I'm talking about Lebon Dombale. He has his own wine stall in the market.
"The other day I bought a bottle of rare [QUOTE]Golden Breg[QUOTE] from him, can you imagine? Yes, yes, the very rum, because of which Helseth loves the Empire so much!"
"Well, you know the story about King Helseth and his rum? Yes? Ha ha ha!"
Lebon Dombale had serious problems with his caravan. But they say that he found a solution.
"Some hero took on the whole gang that attacked Dombale's caravan, saved the cargo and took a large hoard from the leader of the gang."
"Rumor has it that the gang had the assistance of the Abecean pirates, dissatisfied with the competition. Who knows. But these are probably just rumors."
"I think Dombale will go far, since he was able to pull off so much with such a small business. Perhaps it is worth investing in his store."
"I haven't gone to the cemetery for two weeks in a row. And I need to collect herbs there. So you say it's safe now? Well, okay."
"If the Valerius family are smart, they will hide this story. And Elendar should be quieter, otherwise he will rot in prison. Or he will be killed for his wrongdoing."
"There are a lot of heathens in the city. They pray to just about anyone, run to the Nocturnal shrine, donate to Sithis, and then wonder, why is there a crisis in Cyrodiil!"
"That is why the crisis happened. Come to the chapel, pray, donate, get a blessing - and then go, work. Trade, work, fight. Then there would be no crisis."
"Dagail is, of course, very old. And wise, whatever those whiners from the Guild say. She was once a young, promising mystic. So young."
"If not for her reliance on her father's amulet, she would have long since become the Arch-Mage. But now she's obsessed with this trinket. Ugh! Stupidity!"
"If she had followed my advice then... Oh, what can I say now! Well at least she found a little place for herself in Leyawiin."
Have you heard what Sindar is saying to himself? No? Talk to him. He thinks he is the head of a secret guild or even a Daedra prince himself! Ha ha ha!
"Follow him. When he thinks that no one sees him, he walks so funny! Like an emperor on a guard parade! Ha ha ha ha!"
Skooma! Skooma is poison! Poison in a sweet wrapper. Drinking skooma is like falling slowly onto a sword. You will die sooner or later. I think it's sooner.
We will do our best to rid people of their addiction. But I can't gag them.
I saw Olivia's ghost. We prayed to the Nine for her soul. The rest is the business of the mages and the Valerius family. She rests in peace now - that's good.
I have a lot of trouble with students who are terribly absent-minded and unprepared. There are also many problems associated with the work of our department.
"Unfortunately, there is no time for research at all, since I started working with S'drassa. What can be done?"
But I am glad that I was able to save Dagail from everyday problems. Her visions are extremely important for the correct analysis and planning of events.
I recently received a letter from the Council expressing gratitude and support. This is very encouraging!
"Hoo! Who do I see? Our glorious lady heroine! Probably, Black Brugo could not even imagine that such a beauty would come for his head! Ah!"
"Eh, where is my youth. Ahem... I hope to see our heroine often at receptions with Count Marius? Maybe I can show you the library here?"
"No? Shame, shame. You reject me completely. And I, an old man, would have been so experienced. Well, I dare not delay."
"The Mages Guild does not recommend buying anything from Carmina the Herbalist. She is not a certified alchemist, and her potions have not been tested."
We sell wonderful potions and scrolls created by experienced mages.
"Last week I asked Kantav Cheynoslin for a coin. So he blushed, pouted and began to mumble that he had forgotten his coinpurse at home."
"And then he ran away, as if Molag Bal himself was chasing him. Miser. May Zenithar drop an anvil on his leg!"
"Janar does not go to the port. There are ships that smell of salt and wind. They make Janar worry. Janar is ready to sail far, far away in ships."
"But it is too late for Janar to sail from city to city. And so he stays. M'aiq, he runs fast. Janar cannot do that. Therefore, he does not go to the port."
"Recently, we received a request from Count Marius to replace Tsavi as the count's mage. This is not a very wise decision."
The Leyawiin Mages Guild is unlikely to agree with this decision. I think the Council will also support us. Tsavi is an experienced mage with an excellent reputation.
"Of course I'm very busy. I gave up both my research and my dreams for Dagail and for the smooth running of the Guild, it is more important."
But I really want to see recognition for my efforts. I am not asking for money and fame. But they could provide blankets and the necessary supply of equipment for the students!
"In the end, I wrote to the University three times asking to allocate money for equipment, and in response - silence. It's outrageous!"
Why is everyone so excited for the results from S'drassa? S'drassa can create a cure. But it's much easier to disperse the skooma den and arrest the skooma merchants.
But nobody does that! Why? Dagail said that she heard the screams of those who died from skooma. It's scary. Why isn't anyone doing anything?
Gossip? Do you need a potion for talkativeness? No? Ah that... (snorts) you want to talk gossip! What will the youngsters want next.
So you gossip with a stranger and wake up in the morning in the canal. At the bottom. In the form of a drowned man. Ha ha ha ha!
Anyone can take a stick and hit. Or take a sword and kill. Try to grab a pen and write a book. Or at least a story. Can you do it?
Go tell Bugak gro-Bol that a good warrior doesn't need books. We lost a bit of joy when the little goblin poet ran away. It's a pity.
"Leyawiin is a rich and beautiful city. Fortunately, Count Marius very wisely keeps the city running and does not give offense to the Argonians and Khajiit."
"Some of the count's entourage would like to see Leyawin as only an imperial city. But that's not right, it is unwise."
"I do not understand. Elendar, of course, is very talented, since he managed to get Olivia back. But how do they live together? I hope they go to Summerset."
"The Mages Guild, Count Marius and the Valerius family will do anything, so that Elendar and Olivia do not bother the townspeople with their bad example and not anger the Aedra."
"Janar is always looking for new books. They share wisdom and strength with him. Then Janar sells them and goes to the tavern, to look for beautiful girls."
"Books are more interesting than girls, but night is not the time for books. It's time for wine and women. Books, wine and women are the wealth of the merry Khajiit!"
N'ursa is a lovely cat. But she likes to sit in the tavern in the evenings. Her husband should take a belt and teach N'ursa well.
"If he did that, the goblins would stop appearing. Just where are they? She tore out all the hair on his head. Hee hee hee."
Poor Olivia has finally found peace. Elendar was mad to think he could change things. He should go back to Summerset.
"He is a good mage and alchemist, but we all need rest sometimes. I think no one will object to his departure."
"Hlidara Mothril is a very intelligent woman. And decisive, yes. She helps the count and his wife run the county."
I just wish she was a little kinder... And a little more subtle.
S'drassa's work is very important to the entire Mages Guild. The Council of Mages and the Elder Council keep a close eye on his research on skooma addiction.
"If S'drassa can create a potion to cure skooma addiction, we could save hundreds of lives. Of course, the best conditions for work have been created for him."
The University fools often laugh at Dagail. Why don't they ask themselves - how has this very old and wise woman managed to survive when so many powerful mages have not?
"Perhaps it is not very clever to laugh at a mystic and seer of this level. Fortunately, Archmage Traven understands this well."
We have a very good Mages Guild. Agata does a great job with students. She is always very busy.
"But the venerable Dagail may not be distracted by minor problems. And S'drassa does his research all the time, not caring about anything."
"I apologise, but I do not gossip while working."
"I beg your pardon, citizen, but the captain does not approve of idle conversations on duty."
"Child, people talk a lot. Their voices are like a canvas with coloured brush strokes. Each colour is joy, sadness or envy, grief or thirst."
"I hear them, but I do not listen. The amulet helps me hear the voices of the past and the future. I can see the ways, child. Go, listen to the colours of the city, child."
"People consider the Khajiit as thieves and robbers. But this is not the case! The Khajiit are not human, and do not measure happiness in possessions. We enjoy life. Why tie a bunch of things to yourself."
"There are so many of them around. You don't use all things at once, do you? Why do you scold the Khajiit if he took the thing you don't need now?"
"If you need it, take it. If you don't need it, give it back. Isn't that right?"
"The Invels are worried about something. They are said to be in serious disagreement with the Imperial Trading Company. If I were in their place, I would be worried too."
"From time to time, the guards bring some Argonians into the basement. They look like port beggars and paupers. Ragged and smelly."
"But what is strange is that they are not being taken to the dungeon, but to the basement. What would the guard do there with all sorts of rogues?"
"Damn Imperials! And the damn money! Where did Bertrand's attackers run to? Well, at least young Jacques survived."
"Some details of the Bertrand Lumier story have reached me. A very strange story. Well, it ended successfully."
It is said that Tsavi found the notes of the great Topal the Pilot himself in the castle library. And that they indicate where he hid his treasures.
"Of course, this was all a long time ago, and hardly anyone would be going to look for these treasures, but it could be an interesting adventure, right?"
"Poor N'ursa, day after day, cannot properly trade. She stands and shakes. It is no surprise that she earns almost no money."
"And her berries were much larger before. But now, some vegetables and very few strawberries. Her berries were bought every morning for the count's table."
"Everything is calm in the city. The guards are on duty. Good day, citizen."
"I often come here. It is quiet down here, the guards are nearby. The whole city is walking past me. Some to the cathedral, some to the market. A coin will be given. Not always but enough."
"Manius Valerius recently gave two whole septims. Since the death of his wife, he himself does not come here. Before her death, he was always busy, but now he has stopped."
"But then, something went wrong at the cemetery. At night something howls and howls. And the guards... they walk past quickly."
"I saw it from behind, but how scary it looked! Immediately I was dumbfounded. And its eyes, I'm not lying at all, shine! Yes, yes! Oh, the horror!"
"The other day, the whole quarter was awakened by the screams of N'ursa. She was returning from the tavern and saw a monster in her garden."
I must tell her husband not to let her stay at the tavern so late. And to fix the fence.
"So Manius did put his wife to rest? Of course you can't undo what happened, so let it be. And who's to blame? He didn't keep track of his young wife."
"These are all legionnaire manners. How many times have I told him, look how my wife and I live! We don't run around the streets, we don't give a reason for gossip."
"And now he urgently needs to marry off his daughters. Let him go to the Imperial City. You see, everything will be forgotten here, and there Olivia's relatives will help."
I don't think I can tell you anything interesting.
"Recently, N'ursa, a market trader, complained that someone was constantly stealing her berries. Imagine, every morning one or two beds are eaten."
"And a couple of days ago, she was scared by some monster right in her garden. Knocked N'ursa off her feet and tore her dress. The poor thing was so scared!"
"Of course, we could not even imagine that the Argonians brought their sacred tree into the city. It is a pity that we did not find out about this in time. Hmm..."
"But now the hist is destroyed. Maybe you should think about restoring the Blackwood Company? Perhaps, under the patronage of the count?"
"The city guards advise against visiting the cemetery at night, citizen. It might not be safe there."
"Recently a relative came to Hlidara Mothril. And then one evening I go home, I look ahead of me and Hlidara and her relative are walking."
"Both are already pretty tipsy. The relative suddenly looks scared, and asks Hlidara, [QUOTE]What if a sex maniac attacks us?[QUOTE]"
"And Hlidara answers her, [QUOTE]Not with our luck, dear![QUOTE]"
"In the cemetery at night, some kind of vile practice is going on. I saw a ghost. Why aren't the guards doing something!"
Recently I went to the cemetery late at night and saw a ghost there! The ghost of a woman! I screamed so much that even the guard was scared!
"Ah! Our hero! You cleverly dealt with those scum. Well, tell me how you killed Brugo? Ha ha ha! You're a clever fellow!"
"You should join the Imperial Legion. Do you want to serve under me? No? Well, as you wish. But what a handsome man! Ah! Like a stallion!"
Carmina's outrageous behavior is not even surprising. What she won't do in order to sell a couple more useless potions.
I wish her potions weren't so risky to use. If only Carmina would listen to our recommendations even a little!
"The Mythic Dawn is a very dangerous cult. If you see any of the followers of the Mythic Dawn, immediately report him to the guard."
"Ah, child, people talk so much. Their voices are hard to hear. Without my amulet, I cannot understand what they are saying. Go, child, I'm tired."
"Khajiit don't drink skooma. We love moon sugar. Skooma destroys the body and soul, destroys the mind and makes a ruin out of the Khajiit."
Enslaved to its taste! Good wine is much tastier and healthier than skooma. It makes his heart happy and attracts him to adventure. And to women!
"Recently, Carmina the Herbalist and the proud Alves Uvenim from the Mages Guild fought like a cat and a dog, right in Cathedral Square."
They almost started throwing their potions at each other. The guards had to separate them and even escort the mage to the doors of the Guild.
The Mages Guild will insist on investigating Elendar's actions and we may decide to accuse him of necromancy.
"So he'd better leave Leyawiin as quickly as possible. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of the Valerius family, but we respect their opinion."
"Tsavi, mage of castle Leyawiin, is a very inquisitive and intelligent Khajiit. She even managed to tidy and organize the castle library."
"They say the count is very pleased. Moreover, according to rumors, she managed to find the notes of the founder of Leyawiin, Topal the Pilot."
I wonder what she will do with them?
What do you want? Do I remind you of the woman at the fountain who talks to everyone all day about everything and everyone? No?
Then find yourself a book and read it on a bench. I can offer you little.
"Oh yes, Elendar is very talented. He helped me understand how poison enters the brain and how it can be dealt with."
"But, apparently, love is too strong a poison. Poor Elendar. However, they are unlikely to dare to harm him. The count is too hesitant."
So Elendar will most likely just leave. I hope I can still contact him.
"Did you hear what happened to Miro's Scribe Services? I always said there weren't enough guard patrols behind the Great Chapel, but nobody listened."
"Poor Rhea, someone burnt her house down! She had nothing but bad luck from the day she left Woodhearth."
"First the ship was caught in a storm, then pirates attacked and she lost all her money, so she was forced to sell some family heirloom when she arrived here, and could still only afford a small out of the way house."
And now she's been murdered!
Once I went into the basement right behind the guards. But - neither the guards nor the Argonian were there! Can you imagine?
And then I went down there again to get candles for the countess. And I heard there... Just don't tell anyone!
I heard such terrible screams! He shouted so... Shouted so that I forgot why I was there. I ran away and hid in our bedroom. My hands are still shaking.
"Please, don't tell anyone what I said. I don't want the guards to take me to this basement. I have to run. All the best."
"They wear red robes and hide their faces under hoods. When they attack, they usually use a special bound armor, the colour of dark silver."
"Yes, here's another way - if you see the book [QUOTE]Mysterium Xarxes[QUOTE] at someone's home, then this is definitely an agent of the Mythic Dawn. Run to us at once."
"We thought it was safe here! You promised! But we were threatened, they want to kill both me and my wife. This is... This is outrageous!"
"You must take action immediately. After all, I pay taxes!"
"Oh, it's you? We were so scared! Go to John, he will tell you everything. John is so nervous. I'm a little uncomfortable myself."
"But I will pay. You must take care of our safety, otherwise I will complain to the count!"
"Either you take action so we can live freely, or we leave immediately! Lisa! Pack your things! Lisa! They don't want to help us."
"Again those bandits, those killers. We are poor farmers, we're not going to trade skooma and all that! It's impossible!"
"How do you expect us to work if they threaten our lives? Huh? Our lives! Here. This letter! They promise to kill us, but you do nothing."
You stand here as if I should be protecting Greyland. What if they kill us? What then? Who will protect us?
"All you say is [QUOTE]Ah, dear Vernick, you can have Greyland as your home![QUOTE] and then I'm expected to trade skooma and feed these bandits."
"Oh, no. Don't hold your breath, We're packing our things and we're leaving. Yes."
"Just do something! Why are you standing here like a statue? You promised to protect us, don't just stand there! Do I really need to pack my things?"
Letter? Here. Take it. If they kill us... if you let this happen! I... I don't know what I'll do!
Again? What is it this time? A threatening letter? Well well...
"They threaten the Vernicks with death, and demand that their couriers and cargo be hidden on the farm? Surely this is the same company. What do you think?"
"Apparently we didn't catch everyone. I'll tell you what, we must take them on the spot. I and my men will go to the farm, you finish your business and join us."
Just don't delay. You never know when this rabble might decide to attack. Do you think the Vernicks might warn the bandits?
"But he won't help the bandits. I understand. A coward, of course, but with principles. It is important that he and his wife survive."
We will wait for you at Greyland.
Nice find. Let's see who is so brave in our county that he wants to trade in skooma again.
"Wow! Not who I expected. Ri'Shar, the census and excise officer. This is news! Run to the port immediately, we need to arrest Ri'Shar. And his assistant."
This one does not know. The boss quickly packed up and left.
"J'Haurr wanted to run after him, but Ri'Shar ordered this one to hide everything remaining. But J'Haurr did not obey. No. J'Haurr is a good Khajiit."
"This one didn't help bad people, no. This one will help. Here, the notebook of Ri'Shar. This one has kept it for you."
"So definitely guilty. I'll ask the Leyawiin guard captain to put him on a wanted list, but you'll have to search for him too."
"First, search his office well. Perhaps you can find clues. Hurry up before the city guards trample everything there."
"Then what are you doing here? Do I really need to tell you about your every step? Go and get him, if possible."
"In his haste, he left too many papers behind him. He was a literate Khajiit, cautious. This is good. This will help us."
"While you follow him, we will clean everything up here, and catch all the remaining accomplices."
"Hmm... Well, to Oblivion with him. I sent all the papers to the Imperial City, and await an answer. They promised to assign me the rank of captain."
"If it works out, my men and I deserve it. And there will be better pay."
"It's too early to celebrate. Listen... the steward spoke with me earlier, On-Staya Sundew. She asked me to send you to her."
"I don't know what she needs, but you'll have to go. I promised, and she never calls just like that. Something important, I guess."
"Captain's rank, finally! I've been waiting so long for this. At last! Without your help it would never have happened. Thank you."
I'll go tell my men. And a new uniform must be ordered. See you. Hopefully we'll do work together again some day.
"That's just great! I hear about your successes from all sides, yours and Lerexus Callidus. From the steward, the Primate, and even Lady Mothril."
Everyone says that you managed to accomplish the impossible and completely expel the skooma from Leyawiin. I appreciate your efforts.
"For Lerexus Callidus, I have a special reward. I have asked Chancellor Ocato for a patent for the rank of Captain of the Imperial Guard."
And today I put the name Lerexus Callidus on the patent. Here. Take it and please him. Captain of the Imperial Guard - that sounds impressive!
"And for you I have a special title. As the count of Leyawin city and county, and with the consent of the Leyawin County Council,"
"I, Count Marius Caro, confer upon you the honorary title of [QUOTE]Vanquisher of Skooma[QUOTE]. Congratulations!"
"Skooma? No, not this time. It's much easier. I have been ordered to find someone to occupy the Greyland farm. So that no one else can use it as a den."
"Of course, this is none of your business, but I just don't know how to tackle it. I can't go around asking if someone would take Greyland."
"Moreover, the county authorities washed their hands of it. It turns out that Greyland is not their property and they have no time to deal with this farm."
I will be very grateful if you can help me.
Excellent! I know you will succeed. Find me as soon as everything is arranged.
"Damn! I hope you change your mind. If you do, please come see me."
"By the Nine, not Greyland again. Calidus is quite annoying with his concern about Imperial property, but I really don't know how to help."
"Greyland? This is a farm near the city. But this is not a ship, and you can't unload goods there. Why do you ask Ri'Shar about Greyland?"
"Just out of respect for you... if you think... Yes, I can suggest some names. But just name them, the rest is none of my business."
Should Ri'Shar name candidates who want to live in Greyland? Why doesn't Ri'Shar name the next emperor?
Or guess the price of fish in Cheydinhal next summer? Ri'Shar cannot do such things! This one is the harbor master. Nothing more.
"However, it would be better to ask at the census and excise office in the port, they have information about all newcomers. Yes, I think you should ask Ri'Shar."
"Ri'Shar respects the steward On-Staya Sundew. Yes. Therefore, Ri'Shar will name. Vernick. John Vernick and his wife."
They recently arrived from High Rock and now stay in Five Claws Lodge. They will probably want to see the farm. This one thinks they will.
Can Ri'Shar go about his business again? Or is there anything else you need his advice on?
"Speak to my husband, he would be happy to talk about any available farm."
"It would be great to have a new farm. If Greyland has enough land then we could harvest food for sale. They say it is good land, but..."
"But it is unsafe there. There are bandits, just this morning there was talk about several thugs living there. They say this is a hideout for skooma dealers."
"If the farm were cleared, if someone was to kill the bandits, then my wife and I could start rebuilding the farm."
"And we also need a little money. A small loan, to buy seeds, tools, boards. A thousand septims, no more. If all this happens, then we are ready."
"Oh, Greyland is cleared, for the second time? Commendable work. I can help these people a little. And I will even make a report about this for the count."
"Leyawiin helps those who are willing to work the land. Within reason. In this case, I will give 1000 septims. This should be enough."
I hope that the migrants will settle in their new place.
"Excellent. My wife and I are ready to take over the farm immediately. Greyland, huh? It must be a lovely place."
And money? Will someone lend us money to get started?
Then we're ready. We'll leave today. Let's start putting that farm in order.
"Come back in a week, we'll show you a new farm."
Very well. We tidied it up a bit and are planting some crops. So much work ahead!
"Perfectly! This is a new life, Greyland is a wonderful place. We have already purchased everything we need in Leyawiin, and we are waiting for the first harvest."
"And when we sell it, we can rebuild everything here. This will be a wonderful farm! How grateful we are to you!"
Be sure to visit us in a month. We will treat you to lunch and our new cider!
Great. I will immediately send a report to the capital. Hopefully they will finally deliver on their promise of a new rank.
Poor Milena! They just rebuilt the house. What terrible news for her.
"Of course, she needs to be told about Alan and receive the letter. You'll probably find Milena at home, it's right beside the southern gate leading to the harbor."
Tell her that her grief is also mine. I will visit Milena soon and help as much as I can.
"Poor Milena! They only recently began to live together, in a new house. I will take care of the poor girl. Of course, I will help her."
"Tell Milena about Alan, but take care, please. She is either at home or reading in the Lion's Gazebo."
Oh... Alan... My Alan! What should I do now? I... I can't even bury him. He left so quickly this time. I was in the market...
"Alan... darling... We didn't even say goodbye. Oh, gods, what now!"
Help? What? What can be done?
"Wait. I want to bury Alan here in Leyawiin. Can you bring his body here, home? Huh? Please bring him!"
I will bury Alan in our family grave and will visit him every day. I will talk to him... I will tell him the news.
He loved listening to me when I came home from the market.
Thank you. I will wait for him.
"His body? Of course, it wasn't left on the street. I sent Alan's body to the Mages Guild and asked them to hold him for several days under a freeze spell."
"Ask Carahil, she will tell you how to get the body to Leyawiin. And convey my condolences to Milena, poor girl."
"Yes, we have the body of a man from the bay, delivered by Newheim. Do you want to take him to Leyawiin? But the corpse simply won't last on such a trip."
"If you want to take the body to Leyawiin, you need to help us with the embalming. Here is a list of the ingredients required for an embalming compound."
"Then go, we will prepare for your return. And hurry, the body lay on the street for a long time, we have no more than five days to perform embalming."
"Fine. We'll start embalming now. Tomorrow at noon the body will be sent to Leyawiin by ship, and Milena will be informed when it has arrived. She will be able to bury the body in three days."
"The work of our specialists will need to be paid for, the embalming costs 300 septims."
Fine. Everything will be done on time.
"Unfortunately, we cannot afford free labor, the services of the Mages Guild must be paid for. Look for money and come back. And hurry up."
"Yes, I received the body. The funeral will be tomorrow. Now we are saying goodbye to my dear Alan."
"Thank you for your help. Oh, but where is the amulet?"
"Alan's amulet. Round, with a pearl. I gave it to Alan when we moved in together. It was my mother's, but it's missing. Do you know where it is?"
The amulet must have been stolen. Removed... from the body... (sobs)
Thank you. Thank you. Please bring the amulet quickly. I'll be waiting.
Huh? What amulet? You're talking rubbish!
"Oh no, it's you again? Don't touch me! I'm an old man! I haven't bathed for half a year. Girls don't like me!"
Here. Here is the amulet. Take it and leave me alone! Get out! Don't touch me!
"Thank you! Thank you. This is my memory of mother, Alan, our life... Thank you!"
"Thank you. Don't say anything. Let's meet tomorrow after the funeral, I will be calmer then. Okay? You will find me either here or in the cemetery."
"Thanks again. Without you, I couldn't have buried Alan. Here, take this amulet. It's of little value, but still. I have almost nothing..."
Yes. I thought it over. I will sell the house and invest in trade. Lebon and Bugak gro-Bol will help me.
And Boner Droz of Colovian Traders will send the necessary recommendations to the company's offices in Skingrad and Bravil.
"So everything will be fine. I'll start a new life and with Alan's amulet... Alan will stay with me, in my heart, in my memory. But I want you to have this other amulet, to remember us by."
Go. Good luck and Mara's blessing on you.
"My man is in trouble. Well, that is, he got into this... situation, which is unusual. Well, he got in a fight with a guard."
And they put him in the castle dungeon. They say he dishonored the guard by beating him up.
"But the guard started it. Gunnar punched him in the nose, and the guard drew his sword. Well, Gunnar had a box in his hands."
"He'd bought me a present, and was threatened with a sword. Gunnar kicked him in the legs, and then in the ribs. And then other guards came running, like crabs on carrion."
"Well, they arrested him, of course. And people told me, they say, there is a person who helps. And they pointed to you. So I ask - can you help?"
What? Gunnar was killed? Oh... Killed...
"A great weight off my mind! Well, thanks to you! They spoke truth about you. Shor willing, in a year I will see Gunnar. You think he will wait?"
"He will wait. And the guard, you say, can only sing now? Well, okay. Serves him right. Here. Your payment as promised. I must run, the masters are tired of waiting."
"They said at the market. You don't know? A Khajiit was one. Never mind. They said, ask him, he can help, but we cannot."
I'm betrothed to Gunnar. Father even reached an agreement with Gunnar's father. We're from Whiterun. Have you heard? My dad kept a smithy.
"And Gunnar's father was the jarl's guard. They say that he did not sire Gunnar with an honest Nord, but got confused with an orc. Or even a troll."
"He grew up as a bull. We grew up side by side. Then dad moved here, to the Empire, and he settled here in the city. He died in the third year. And here I am."
"They said at the market. You don't know? A Khajiit was one. Never mind. They said, ask her, she can help, but we cannot."
I'm betrothed to Gunnar. Father even reached an agreement with Gunnar's father. We're from Whiterun. Have you heard? My dad kept a smithy.
"And Gunnar's father was the jarl's guard. They say that he did not sire Gunnar with an honest Nord, but got confused with an orc. Or even a troll."
"He grew up as a bull. We grew up side by side. Then dad moved here, to the Empire, and he settled here in the city. He died in the third year. And here I am."
"I serve the nobles, in House Valerius. And Gunnar came for me. He wants to take me back to Skyrim. Only now you see with the guard what happened."
"I went to the castle, but they didn't let me in. And this woman who is their head guard, the Dragon, or something, also says that they will hang Gunnar."
"So I ask, help him not to be hanged. I can pay - I will pay, by my honor. I'll pay you fifty septims if you help."
"Well, it's clear that they won't let him go. Bashed a guard over the head, and then in the face again. At least he didn't kill him, otherwise they would've hacked Gunnar to death then and there."
And I don't ask you just to request they let him go. Get him out of prison for me. And then to the port. He can leave by ship - the guards won't see him leave that way. I made an agreement at the port.
"I paid for his place on a ship, and to keep quiet, I gave fifty septims to the clerk. I just got back. Can you help, huh?"
"Thank you. You get him to go to the port, to the Safe Harbor Tavern. Everything is arranged. They will put him on a ship and he can go home."
"And I agreed to settle accounts with the manager next year, and then I can join Gunnar. He will have to wait. Do you think he will?"
"I'm going to get him on the road for the time being. Well, by the grace of Shor!"
"Ah... Well, fie on you. Looks like people were lying when they said you can help. You are worthless!"
Borgunna sent you? So she didn't give up? Tell her not to go see my hanging. Nothing for her there. Ehh.
"Why did I get into a fight? How can I stay quiet when that arse says I'm going to marry a scruffy, stupid woman."
"I heard it and it was as if I was boiling over. I said [QUOTE]hey, you, you old arse, what did you say about my love? Apologise, you ogre, otherwise I'll punch you in the nose![QUOTE]"
"Really, just because he's on duty, he can say anything to people? Well, I... thwack! And he screamed for help, and he began to grab his sword."
"Why would he grab his sword? I told him [QUOTE]put it away, skeever, or I'll shove it in your arse up to the hilt[QUOTE]. And I jumped forward like this, hyuh! And knocked him down! No fighter, that scrib."
"Well, as my dad taught me, I kicked him in his kidneys... And then the others came running. Struck me on the back of the head from behind, and I was knocked out."
"No. They won't allow it. They are very cruel. Yes, I spoke to the dragon lady, she said I stained their honor. Well, there is more..."
"About the scrib, he said that he would kill me! My Borgunna, she rushed to pull us apart, and she kicked him in the balls, punched him in the head! I have a real warrior woman there!"
"So two more guards arrived, they grabbed her, and they yelled at her. They called her a girl. And that's it... The present was lost, such a pity. I had gathered amber for her."
"And I had to give them up under threat of the sword. Everything fell apart. But that scrib's balls, I suppose, still hurt. Borgunna's leg is strong."
He now can only delight his friends with sweet singing! Ha ha ha!
"So no, they won't let me go."
"Escape? No, well, I can run away, if there's no other option. But the guards are angry, they want to hurt me, they look like hungry horkers. So I'll have to wait."
"Maybe it will cost more? Well, I'll tell the count that I defended my woman. He might understand that? Or is it too late?"
"If only I could know for sure. Hey, you ask the guards, or their dragon lady, let me know if I really need to run? I'm ready, I just have to get out of the cell."
"If you find out that after all, Sovngarde is waiting, then come back and sneak me out, I'll be ready. Eh, look, that guard is heading in our direction. You find out and let me know, go on."
"Oh, I don't know what happened. It was not on my watch."
I was ordered not to talk about it.
"The guards will not discuss these events, citizen."
"Yes, I ordered the Nord to be taken into custody, and soon a fair trial by Count Marius awaits him. Most likely, the Nord will be hanged."
"In Leyawiin, no one is allowed to attack the honored guards with impunity. And even more so, to beat them up."
"You need to talk to the captain. Find Caelia Draconis, captain of the Leyawiin Guard."
"I feel sorry for old Vilkas. The boy beat him well. Although Vilkas was unrestrained in his language, he's one of us. So..."
"Our guard captain is dead. Sorry citizen, but until a new guard captain is appointed, no one can help this prisoner."
"I trust what my people report to me, and only that. They did not report that Valkis said any insult to Gunnar. This conversation is over."
Borgunna does not sit in the next cell only thanks to the intercession of Mr. Valerius and the request of Mr. Orius.
We have nothing more to talk about. The Nord will be justly punished!
Did you pick the lock? Let's go then. Try to move quietly.
"Oh, thank you! I know who to see at the port. The plan was passed on to me when you were speaking to the guards."
Tell Borgunna I'll wait for her as long as necessary. I would not trade her for anyone.
"No, I don't know anything about the notes. Let me have a look. Oh my... he was not afraid..."
How interesting. The author must be found quickly and taken to the castle. He will enjoy great success with the public.
"Oh, did you find this note? I don't know who wrote it, but it's so sweet."
"Yes, my neighbor said that someone is scattering sheets of poetry around the city. So pointless."
"Can I see? Oh, these verses remind me of something I heard as a child."
"Yes, yes. Notes. I've heard. Such stupidity. Littering the streets."
I don't understand why the author has not been found yet.
"I do not know, citizen, I have not seen any notes."
"You found a note? But you don't know who left it. No, I don't know either."
"No, I don't know anything about these notes. No, nothing."
"No, I don't know anything about any notes."
"What note, show me. What rubbish. There is no need to bother anyone about such nonsense."
"This... This is outrageous, slanderous libel! It's just shameful! It must absolutely stop! Where are the guards looking?"
"Curious. The author undoubtedly has a philosophical mindset. Yes, curious. You say you don't know who the author is?"
"Let me read it. Well, not all mages are like that. But rightly noted, hmm..."
"The note is interesting, the author is fluent in words. And he has a fine sense of humor."
That's a strange question. How would I know?
"Well, there are so many people passing by in a day, it's hard to notice who doesn't!"
"Ha! The whole city was here, or will be in the coming days."
"I don't know, it seems like everyone goes. You ask a strange question."
Go ask Decentius Opsius in the Coast Guard Station. He knows everyone and everything that happens here.
How would I know?
"And why should I know something about the author of some scraps of paper, found who knows where?"
So? A questionable trail. Well...
"Perhaps this is the one you want. I'm talking about Janar the Philosopher from the Khajiit Quarter. At one time, he was severely beaten by sailors here in the port."
"And just for some poems read at the wrong time, or to the wrong people. Since then he has not been in port."
"Oh, you found them. Is that all of them? I don't remember how many of these messages I left, but more than a dozen for sure."
Wasn't it interesting for you? I leave crumbs of ancient wisdom and joy of living. Is that so bad?
"Find all my notes, there aren't many more. And I will give you something that is dearer than a cup of wine, a smile from a beauty or a lump of moon sugar."
"Good luck, friend!"
"You did a great job, friend. Here, take this. This book was written a long time ago, I don't even know who the author was."
"He was undoubtedly a Khajiit. Only we know how to enjoy the sun and sugar, wine and hot kisses so much. I rewrote this book from the words of M'Aiq the Wise."
For some reason you call him Liar. Probably because he sees more than many and knows more than many.
He said that the author of the book could be called Oman... or Omar? Never mind. It was a glorious Khajiit. Good luck friend!
"Thank you, cousin. Here, take this. This book was written a long time ago, I don't even know who the author was."
I just know he's a Khajiit. I took this book when I was invited to visit the Mane. You know M'Aiq the Swiftfoot? This was his book. He gave it to the Mane.
"I thought I needed it more. Now you need it more. Take it, cousin. Glorious feats should not overshadow the taste of moon sugar and the hot sands of Elsweyr."
"Good luck, littermate!"
"Would you like to donate to the Great Chapel of Zenithar? Oh, how noble of you! Please, share a little of your wealth with those in need. And the light of Zenithar..."
So little...
"That is, I wanted to say that Zenithar sees your efforts, and any amount will be counted for the good! But think of the many orphans and poor who cry for help."
Sacrifice a generous amount and Zenithar's mercy will be endless!
"Here is a decent sum from a respected and, I note, a wealthy citizen of our glorious Leyawiin. It's not hard at all, is it?"
The light of Zenithar will shine on you and illuminate the path in the darkness of ignorance and suffering!
"On good deeds, of course! The Chapel of Zenithar takes care of the welfare and health of the poor. How could you think of anything else?"
Do you suspect me of dishonesty and pettiness? Shame on you.
"But I believe it's just a brief confusion, don't you agree? I shall take this money now, go in peace!"
You will see what benefits the Great Zenithar will shower on the unfortunate!
"I will wait. Remember, helping those who suffer is a matter of paramount importance and essential for those who would seek the mercy of the gods!"
"Yes, good sir. Zenithar's grace is with us. Silana came, Silana Blandia. A kind woman. Healed me and my husband."
"She left some food, and money for a bedspread. Silana is very kind. Avrus is not so kind, he is strict."
"But he protected us when they wanted to take our house. Avrus does not give money, he teaches Otumeel to pray and sometimes gives us paid work in the chapel."
"Khajiit sweeps the streets every day. It's hard, but Khajiit wants to eat. When Mistress Silana comes, she brings delicious fish, yes. She is a good person."
Dar'Rash does not go to the chapel. The Khajiit are not welcome where Mistress countess and Mistress Hlidara Mothril pray. Not at all.
"Khajiit doesn't need to listen to all this nonsense about the greatness of the gods and the grace of Zenithar. Lady Silana brings mercy home to the Khajiit. And the Khajiit sweeps the streets, yes."
What are you talking about? I have nothing to eat and nothing to drink in the evening. They give a pittance.
"Why would they want to help the poor, if they are rich and live in a warm place! Imagine, they want me to work at the port!"
"Although everyone knows that I have a bad back. Why do I need to work at the port? After all, you will give me a coin, right? So I can eat."
"Oh, you didn't come to take my food, did you? Or my house? Truly? The port is cold and I am freezing. When I had no home, I was freezing all the time."
Now I have a home. But it's cold. Give me a coin and I can buy some firewood. I have already burned everything that Avrus brought. I suffer so much from the cold!
Zenithar's grace. Poor Ra'dirsha learned what Zenithar's grace is. She has a home. Now it is a warm cozy home.
Avrus swore for a long time and said that we are all lazy and do not want to raise our paws to clean our own tails. That's what he said.
"But Avrus went to speak with someone in the castle and now Ra'dirsha has a home. And she can sleep in a warm crib and sit on a chair. Not like that Deeh. Slacker, yes."
"Mistress Silana said that when Ra'dirsha's hide heals, Mistress Silana will teach her how to embroider. And then Ra'dirsha will not beg."
"Zenithar is merciful to the disadvantaged. The weak, the infirm, he helps those who cannot prosper through honest labor and trade."
"In his words, we support those who strive to achieve something, who do not laze around and do not give up. Healing the weak is also pleasing to Zenithar."
The grace of our patron bestows success in work and trade. The worthy citizens of Leyawiin glorify Zenithar by caring for the poor.
"Yes, it makes sense for us to support the poor. Especially if they strive to achieve something. Nobody will give money to someone who makes no effort for themselves, no matter how much they demand."
"To our delight, the count and his wife are listening to the words of Primate Cheynoslin. They help us humble ministers to be of service to the people."
"An empire needs thriving cities with happy citizens. Fortunately, the count correctly perceives the teachings of Zenithar."
"He is an important gentleman. A very self-important, highly vocal, very pleased with himself gentleman. Who doesn't like to give alms, and does not like the poor."
"He doesn't need to love the poor. He serves Zenithar in the Great Chapel, with the countess. Silana and Avrus come to us. That's alright."
"Khajiit won't talk about Kantav. He has a sore tail, which was stepped on by Kantav. Fffff! What a great primate!"
"He's so big he can't see the Khajiit in front of him! Probably Zenithar gave him a lot of importance, but then took his sight."
"Poor master primate. On another occasion, Khajiit will grab his tail and cross to the other side of the road. It's not good to offend a blind man."
What's the point of the primate? He didn't even protect me from the guards when they threw me in jail for fifteen days! For just a couple of coins that I stole!
"I had nothing to eat! They give a couple of coins, which are not enough for beer, and they want me to go work at the port! Tul lives there. Let him work there."
Why would the Lord Primate visit a miserable beggar? My destiny is to freeze here in the port. The Primate does not visit the port.
"Kantav Cheynoslin doesn't like the Khajiit. The Khajiit do not respect the Primate. They offend him. He is so... red? Yes, he is red and tall!"
"Like a big carrot... Oh, Ra'dirsha didn't say that, did she?"
"His grace, Primate Kantav Cheynoslin, diligently and with dignity bears the burden of serving Zenithar. Can there be even the slightest doubt about this?"
The Primate cares for us unceasingly and is constantly seeking funds for the Great Chapel of Zenithar. His words reach the ears of the mighty of this world.
"Fortunately, Zenithar saved Kantav Cheynoslin from the burdens of communicating with the disadvantaged, entrusting us with such hard work. And this is for the best."
"Regretfully, many of those supported by the hand of Zenithar wrongly misjudge the primate's behavior, inflicting severe insults on him."
"While in truth, they ought to show him the utmost reverence, respect and gratitude for the unselfish work and care he does for their needs."
"Sometimes I have to restrain myself, seeing and hearing insolence and impudent words and smirks against the most worthy Kantav."
I do hope that my answer was fulfilling?
"His grace is a little unrestrained. We need to forgive him for small human weaknesses. After all, he redeems them with hard work for the glory of Zenithar."
"Our lord sees that Primate Cheynoslin is diligently instructing the souls of the rich and powerful in the county, leading them along the path of mercy and charity."
"The efforts of His grace were rightfully appreciated by the Elder Council and personally by the Emperor. Kantav Cheynoslin, like no other, is worthy of his rank."
"Fortunately, the primate's inherent wisdom allows him not to go too far beyond the zealous conducting of Imperial politics, and the servants of Zenithar."
I did? Oh... I told Lerexus Callidus to resolve the issue with the skooma den. As he had resolved the issue with Greyland before.
I hope Greyland is okay? The count recently wondered how his new subjects live.
Excellent. So I was not mistaken. You need to clean up the mess in the den now. Count Marius is not concerned how you do it.
In Leyawiin there should be no skooma dens or other kinds of suspicious establishments. This is the order of Count Marius.
"Anything. Within reason, of course. You can't burn it down. But try to find someone who can use this building."
"The county will be ready to provide some assistance. Small... the minimum. Yes. However, you could live there yourself."
"Oh no! Do you know how much I endured when I walked home and saw all this trash, sniffed this stench and avoided their vomit!"
Finally they were dispersed. I'd rather burn a scamp hole than invest in that dump!
Use the former skooma den? I can't imagine any use for it.
Mmm... no. Too much dirt. Such an investment has too high a risk... The building is old.
"What would be the point? No, I don't need such a wreck."
"No, I don't need this dump. But I recently spoke with the Primate, he said he was looking for a house for some purpose of his own."
He was going to open an almshouse or something. So you should talk to him.
"Oh, yes. I did say that I needed a building for a shelter. There are disadvantaged people in the city, whose fate worries our hearts."
"We, the humble servants of Zenithar, with the support of our good friends, the Invel family, are ready to invest what we can in the former den."
"Find my good friend and companion, the Argonian Long Tail, at the Great Chapel of Zenithar and question him. He will tell you how he could help."
Zenithar bless you.
"The former skooma den. We will make this a shelter for all who have no roof over their heads, who need treatment and care. This is a good thing."
"Fortunately, the noble Invels and the Primate heard me and helped me find money. And now we will have our own home. That's wonderful."
I'll go there right away and start putting things in order. Everything will be ready by your return and soon we will be able to open the doors for everyone in need!
"Didn't I say? I apologize. My assistant... My future assistant. I promised Sin-Rei, my home village Guardian, that I would look after him."
"Please visit my village, Sleepy Creek. There you will find our esteemed Sin-Rei, the Guardian. She will help you. The village is north-east of Leyawiin."
"I will immediately go to the former den, as I said. So much work and care for the glory of Zenithar. How wonderful it is!"
I am very glad that Long Tail has found his purpose. He always helped everyone who asked him for help. And he also helped those who did not ask.
"Long Tail was so willing to respond to requests that he left the village, forgetting about his duties. He even forgot to say goodbye."
"Although it was a long time ago, I, as the Guardian of the village, cannot help but remember his deed. And now? Does Long Tail regret this?"
No. He wants to take away another resident of the village to the city. Again he has neglected his native village. He didn't even ask if we needed help!
"Tim-Jah cracked, huh? And what do you want? Helping Long Tail at the shelter? Ahhh... I'm ready. But how can I trust you? I do not know you."
And Guardian Sin-Rei will not let me go. She wants me to stay in Sleepy Creek.
Don't bother yourself. The Argonians are strong and determined people. We will cope with our problems ourselves. Go back to town.
Can we expect help from someone who forgot his home?
"Yes. Forgive me. I transferred my anger to you, anger which I feel whenever I hear the name Long Tail."
It is not right. I can only be excused for the fact that I have not heard the voice of the Holy Hist for a long time and did not find peace in the melody of its foliage.
And there have been too many problems lately for such a small village like ours. Especially since Itan went missing!
"He is from the recent brood and was supposed to replace Long Tail. Itan is an excellent healer, although he has not been trained in magic."
"As a child, I was able to give him the Hist juice. The Sacred Tree is far from here, but I managed to bring the juice. And we were so hoping that Itan would support us."
"Moreover, next to us are the ruins of the fort, filled with necromancers and undead. If not for my art... However, you don't need to know about it."
"It is Itan Long Tail wants to take to Leyawiin. After all, it was he who trained Itan until he ran away from us."
"Let it be so, but we can't find Itan himself this day. He's gone. Vanished! Nobody has seen him."
"If you can... If Itan returns to the village, I'll let him go with you. If Itan wants it himself. But first you have to find him."
"I beg you, do not delay. Perhaps he needs our help."
"I haven't seen him in three days, but he was always strange. The weakest in the brood, but so smart. Helped me count the goods."
"No, I don't know where he is. Maybe someone else saw Itan."
You need to ask our men. I last saw Itan walking towards the sea. But that was several days ago.
"I can't tell you anything, but ask Tim-Jah. He was constantly running after Itan. But I haven't seen Tim-Jah for a couple of days either."
"Yes, Itan went south with Tim-Jah. Definitely. But Tim-Jah is not with him now. Tim-Jah just came running back to carry fish to his mother. Look for him at home."
"Ahhh... Itan? Yes, we went fishing. But then I had to leave to come home. Itan stayed. He does not like to be in the village for long periods."
I'm not telling you anything. I don't know you.
"Thank you very much. Itan will not only help me with the shelter, he can learn and practice helping the poor."
"Who knows, maybe we will soon see a healer of such a level who will glorify both our shelter and our glorious Leyawiin. And Argonians."
This is important. Very important for those who are not wanted in this city.
"I don't know where Itan is. Don't talk to me like that, otherwise I won't say anything at all!"
I'm not telling! Not even thinking about the cave! ...Oops!
"Yes, he is in the cave. It's not far. Go south, just over there, past another cave. Itan found some old shrine there."
"He decided to stay there for now. Well, until the Guardian calms down. After all, he dreams of running away to Long Tail."
"Just don't tell Itan what I said, I promised to be silent. He carried food there to the cave, and I caught him. Well... I saw him carrying food and followed him."
"Itan said not to tell anyone. He showed me the cave, there is an old shrine inside. But he says it's not dead yet, and I wasn't to tell anyone."
"South of the village, it is beyond the other cave, the Onyx Caverns. Even further. There he stays. It's not cold and there is a lot of water."
"Don't say I told you. Itan is like an older brother to me, only he doesn't want to live with us. The Guardian shouts at him. Hey! Can I go already? Huh?"
She probably said that just so you'd look for me. Sin-Rei doesn't want me digging around out here.
There was once a sanctuary here. They say even the Tree Guard was here. I was looking for a way to a closed part of the sanctuary.
"You see, the roots of the old Hist are hidden there. They are alive, I know. I have heard his thoughts several times. He's still alive. Imagine!"
"And if awakened, Sin-Rei would become unnecessary. Then Hist will manage everything here in the district, and Sin-Rei will remain only the eldest in the village."
"She speaks on behalf of the Hist, but she herself does not hear him at all. Therefore, she would not let me go and would not allow me to come here."
"Alright. I will persuade Long Tail to help me later. I'll help him get things done at the shelter, and then he will help me with the sanctuary. Let's go quickly."
"I did a little work here. I hired a few laborers, to put everything in order. We have made good progress, but it's not finished. Thank Zenithar, I know how to work with my hands."
"But we need tools and materials. Primate Kantav Cheynoslin was again able to help a little with money, but now it's all gone."
But I also have to buy medicines. Perhaps you can persuade Alves Uvenim of the Mages Guild to sell cheap potions for the shelter?
"Then we can heal everyone who comes to us. Ask Alves Uvenim, perhaps she will agree? And I have to speak with the steward of the Count."
What are you asking for? For me to sell my potions and elixirs for pennies for this stinking poorhouse run by stupid lizards? Don't be ridiculous!
"Oh, poor children. Their despair and hopelessness are reflected from the stones of the city embankments, from the bridges over the canals and the castle walls. But how can I help them?"
Give my potions to a shelter? I have not yet lost my mind to give them away or sell for pennies! Ha! They'll just laugh at me!
"But you can tell your lizard that once a week I'm going to give him the less powerful batches. Maybe they will cure someone, haha."
"Oh yes, let him send a couple of his guests on Sundas nights, they can clean up at my place for a couple of coins."
"I hope I made you happy? I have things to do, you know."
How can we thank you? There are no words to appreciate everything that you have done for the shelter. Itan has already started collecting herbs for making potions.
And I managed to buy new bedding and some lint for the wounded. And the guards promised to help keep order here.
Even master Dombale agreed to help us with supplies and wine if we keep the street in order.
The steward was asking how soon we will be open. Please let her know that everything is ready and the shelter has started working.
Wonderful. I had no doubts that the shelter would work. I must say that Primate Kantav Cheynoslin is a good organizer.
And Lerexus Callidus is well versed in people and knows how to select assistants for himself. This is good news.
I reported to Count Marius that a new shelter had appeared in place of the skooma den in Leyawiin. The count is pleased.
Now go to Count Marius Caro. He wished to see you personally once everything was decided with the shelter.
"You should charitably send them all to rebuild the Abandoned Mine or any other mine. As a last resort, farmers need labor."
"I'm not going to waste time and energy on any vagrants. Moreover, the ingredients cost money. This conversation is over!"
I am so sorry. But I cannot give the order for the young girl Uvenim to give her potions for less than they are worth. Alas. her rudeness upsets me.
"I will ask her to be merciful and kind. But, understand, you must not judge her. No, no. Alves Uvenim is not bad at heart."
"She only strives for perfection as a master alchemist. And this is expensive, very expensive. I'm sorry that I hear bitterness in your heart."
"Maybe we can help you in another way. For example, your ward can contact us if a suffering soul comes to him."
"I will be happy to help heal someone who is deprived of the peace and harmony of his own spirit. Now go, child. I need to concentrate."
"Do you remember Lonavo? Skooma merchant? So, he has a brother, Veren Lonavo, who is distributing skooma here, in the city itself."
"He cannot be found, he is very careful and cunning. I and my people are known to Lonavo, he disappears as soon as we enter the city."
"You need to find where Veren Lonavo is hiding. To do this, try to follow the skooma merchant who works in the port."
"The only thing we know is that he is Khajiiti. You will most likely find him at the Safe Harbor Tavern, try to trace where he takes the skooma."
"As soon as you know - find me here, in the castle, or at the guard tower in the Khajiit Quarter. I live there."
And be careful. You killed his little brother Kylius Lonavo and he will want revenge. Do not get caught.
"Hey, if it's not me, look for whoever you want. I have nothing to do with this."
"So what? I'm selling booze, not information. And I don't know you at all."
"What a woman! You don't need information, but something else, right? Khajiit can please you, really."
Uh... Khajiit doesn't want to talk to a stranger. Khajiit had a few drinks? Yeah!
Leave me alone.
What do you want to know?
"Do you work for the guard? Oh well, I don't know, I don't get involved in these matters. Dangerous."
And Khajiit are vindictive. Especially the visiting Khajiit.
So look for them yourself. I'm not in that business.
A skooma den? This is very bad. But are you sure? Maybe it is just a flop house for beggars?
"You have to make sure. You need to get into the house and find out what's inside. And if this is a skooma den, then we will take the toughest measures."
"This is bad. I didn't think it had gone this far. But since the skooma merchant went there and there's bottles outside... However, perhaps this is just a shelter for the poor?"
"You have to get in there, and find out everything. We need eyewitness testimony. It's dangerous, but I don't see any other way."
"I don't think he'll be there. But it's a possibility, I agree. We need to disguise you. Put on these things."
"They were taken from a dead skooma addict. Make your face suitably scuffed. I think you'll pass for one of them. Yes, here's some money for a dose."
"I hope you won't use it? Make sure that there really is a skooma den there, and report back to me."
"And if Lonavo suddenly appears... Run away, he is a very dangerous opponent. Good luck to you. Oh yes. Hide your weapons. Don't forget."
"Yes? You do not look unwell. Although you smell like you've been on a three day drinking binge. Okay, take what there is and lie behind the fence. This one will look out."
"A cave with access to the city? It's good that it was empty, we can't lose you. The empire needs such loyal and capable citizens."
"If Veren Lonavo really made the cave his refuge, then we need to immediately smoke him out. Where does the cave go?"
"I know this place. I shouldn't show myself there, I'll scare off the bandits. But tomorrow my boys will be waiting for you at the entrance."
"Tell Afranius, [QUOTE]Forward, Empire.[QUOTE] They will help you in the cave. Oh, and get rid of those old rags now, they reek!"
And may Talos help us.
"Yes, and all thanks to you. On behalf of the Legion, I thank you. I'll send a report to the Imperial City tomorrow."
"I hope you will not refuse to cooperate with me further. Here, take this. It is the least that I can do to thank you. For the emperor!"
"Oh, Tsavi didn't tell anyone about the notes. Well... It doesn't matter to Tsavi, no. But Tsavi is surprised. She is very surprised."
"Unfortunately, everything is damaged. The log itself is difficult to read, and it's written in Old Aldmeris."
It still needs to be restored and translated. And the map is enchanted with protection magic. Strong protection magic. Tsavi failed to dispel it.
"I've been waiting for you. Tsavi sent word. Amazing discovery, huh? Are these the records of Topal the Pilot himself?"
"I will definitely help to translate it. However, it will take a few days. Maybe a whole week."
I don't have as much time as I would like. I've been sent to the Skingrad Mages Guild. I need to deliver important documents.
So the work on the notes will be delayed. What a pity.
"I deciphered the notes. This is a ship's log. More precisely, what survived of it. But not written by the Pilot, rather by his assistant, Eltiar."
These are records of a storm which they could not avoid. Topal had dispatched them to Summerset to return the collected artifacts and resupply.
"During the storm, the ship leaked. Eltiar writes that he managed to hide the artifacts in his chest. It is not clear though, chest, box, ark? Unclear."
Apparently he drew a map as well. But how the log and the map ended up in Leyawiin is unknown. Here's the translation.
"I'll keep the original for now, perhaps I will be able to make out something else. Take the map to Delmar, he will help with the magic which prevents us from viewing it."
"This is very kind. But you will have to go to the Imperial City, to the Arcane University. A good friend of mine, Boderi Farano, works there."
Perhaps she will agree to help with the notes. But Tsavi does not know what to do with the map. Tsavi can't pay much.
"If you help, maybe the map itself will lead to something valuable? Yes?"
"Then go to the Arcane University. The Mystic Archives, find Boderi Farano. You will remember, right?"
Okay. Tsavi is happy to wait. There is still time.
"Really? That's wonderful! And so kind. Then I'll take care of the notes. We need to decipher them and restore them a little, right?"
"Oh, the map..."
"This is fascinating. Such a strong defence spell placed by a true master mage. I can't do anything with it, we must ask Delmar."
"He works in the Chironasium. Of course, he will not be able to help without the notes, so first I need to translate and restore them, then he can remove the protection."
You'd better find out what he needs for this. Go to the Chironasium. Delmar will know exactly what will work... He's quite... prudent.
"Here, take these papers for the Skingrad Mages Guild. Don't forget to visit Delmar at the Chironasium."
"Thank you, I'll take them. These are important papers. Tell Boderi Farano that everything is in order."
"What ancient work. I'm talking about the enchantment. Hmmmm... They really knew how to cast protection spells back then. This is no simple spell, no. It looks like someone with extreme skill cast this."
"You say, Topal the Pilot himself cast the protection on this map? Hmmm... I think he played with time in many of his spells. And very good he was too. This could be one of his spells. It carries the markings of the Psijics."
"They loved that. Stop time, carve out a minute. There a minute, here a minute... Yet they disappeared over time. Or maybe they have not disappeared? Who knows."
"But it will be interesting. I'll work on it, but you must find two Varla Stones for my work. Do you know those? Ayleid devices. Expensive, of course, but..."
"If you want results, bring two stones. That will be enough. Maybe I'll be able to save one, but I can't be sure yet. Leave the map with me. Find the stones, go on."
"Oh, and don't forget to get the translations from Boderi Farano. I won't decipher anything without them. Do you hear? Stones and translations. I'm waiting."
Have you brought the translation? The translation is required. Where are the records?
"It is done. I had some trouble, but it was not so difficult. I only lost one of the stones, this Aldmer put enough energy into the spell to protect the whole ship."
"He panicked, probably thought he would not have time? Can you imagine what was going on in their heads? I myself do not like to be at sea in a storm."
"I wouldn't be afraid, after all, I am an experienced mage, but still it would be alarming, indeed. Hmmm. And they were blown off course. Most likely they swam to the east."
"Here's your map. I don't know if there are any treasures, but it will be interesting to see. If in fact something is found - I'm waiting for my share!"
"Hehe. Just kidding. I've already taken mine, one stone remains with me. But if there really is something interesting - come and bargain. Good luck."
"Let me see. Yes... Got caught in a storm. So... That's interesting. And, here, he wanted to use scrolls. Well, that makes it easier. It means the protection was not cast by a master."
"Then I'll be able to figure it out for sure. For now, find something to occupy yourself for a couple of days, and during this time I will study further and break the spell. Oh yes, the stones. Have you brought them? Hand them over now."
"Did you want anything else? No? Then go, I have to work."
And hurry up. I cannot afford to wait for months for idle seekers of obscure treasures.
"Yes it's me. More precisely, my hypostasis. A piece of my personality trapped in the reliquary. I welcome you to my final Sanctuary."
"Security guards. My copies with specified parameters. They are just watchmen. They exist. But tell me, what year is it now? Who rules Alinor?"
Gods! Third Era? And Summerset? Alinor? The Crystal Tower? Is it safe?
The Emperor is slain? What Emperor? Septim? Wait. You mean... You don't know anything about Summerset. Just think about it. Savages!
Were Topal's experiments successful? Did he manage to make those wild Heartlands and beasts tame? Amazing hard work!
"Truly, Auriel was well pleased with him. Civilized beasts! I wonder how..."
"Yes, beasts, what of it? When we arrived in this region, only animal-people lived here. Wild and practically unintelligent. And further north in the heartlands they still roamed."
"They see themselves as people. This is amusing. Auriel is my witness, they're just savages! Topal was simply looking for a place to build the Tower."
"Yes, he did it? This is good news. What a pity that I could not see it all with my own eyes. And I will never see it, for I shall not return."
I have nothing to do in a world ruled by creatures like you. Communicate with savages who can't even defend their land from the Daedra?
"Please leave. I will send you ashore, and even give you the opportunity to choose a reward, since you made it here. Though truly, little has survived."
"I have my bow, Topal's staff and some gold. Oh, also my amulet. What will you choose?"
Then take it and be gone.
The right choice. Take it. If you manage to survive - the staff is yours. A-ha-ha-ha!
"Why would you... But, whatever, your choice. Get out."
"He made the right decision, three eras have passed. Tsavi is scared to even think about it. Tsavi will have to tell Dagail, she'll be interested. Yes."
Tsavi will go and tell her. It is good that this whole story is over.
"Yes, I have the best wines in Leyawiin. Choose what you like. If you want something special, I can order it separately for you."
"But keep in mind that such an order will cost a lot, and will take time to deliver. What exactly do you want?"
"Oh! I see an expert in front of me. I'm sorry, but I have only one bottle left and it's reserved for Sir Oldstump. Perhaps later I will have a bottle or two."
"Heh. Of course, Summerset wines are both rare and expensive, but their bouquet is magnificent. But where can I get the Autumn Leaf from now?"
This wine should not be expected until next autumn. I hope they bring me at least one box.
"Oh! You know of Shadowbanish? This is a very rare wine. Nerussa from the tavern in Weye spoke of it, but I don't know if she has any."
I will write to my friends in the Imperial City. Come back in a week and get ready to greatly lighten your coinpurse.
I will order three bottles.
"Yes, a very rare wine. But you speak confidently, so you know something about it? Nerussa sent you, huh? It doesn't matter, I'm always ready to help."
"And, of course, make coin at the same time. So get ready to come back in a week with money, it will cost you dearly. You can count on three bottles."
"Yes, I received a response from my suppliers. There is wine. It's just..."
"You see, the wine caravan should have sailed to Leyawiin from Anvil by now, but it seems the caravan did not arrive in Anvil. I have heard nothing from my people, nor any news about them."
"And the ship from Anvil arrived at the port yesterday morning. Alan, my sales agent, always sent me reports from the road. There is no report either."
"You want to help me? This will solve many problems. Find my people, they were supposed to leave Skingrad with a cargo of Surilie Brothers wines."
"From Skingrad the caravan went to Anvil to board the ship to Leyawiin. On the way, they had to pick up some cargo near Miscarcand."
Try to find out what might have happened to them. The main thing is to save my people. Oblivion is to blame if my team dies.
"I can't rush you, but... I'm worried. Hurry, I beg you!"
"As far as I know, we have already sent all the shipments of wine. But my brother, Gaston, is in charge of shipping the wine. Ask him."
"Yes, Dombale's caravan came through Skingrad two weeks ago, collected the wine, and left for Anvil."
"No, I didn't notice anything strange. They took the goods, spent the night and went on. What happened?"
"Here's the thing, I can't help. Everything was done as usual. I can show you the records of the shipment of the goods and the signature of Dombale's clerk."
"Take the road to Anvil. They say bandits and trolls were seen near Miscarcand, so be careful. The caravan was going to stop near Miscarcand briefly."
"I heard a conversation between Alan, the clerk, and the groom. Of course, they had strong security, but on the road it is very dangerous. Good luck with your search."
"Yes, there was one, sort of. Badly battered. I had to call a healer for their leader, called... Alan, I think. They'd lost some of the goods to bandits."
"They spent the night, received healing, recovered what they could from the remaining goods, and drove off."
"Fortunately for them, an Imperial patrol arrived. The patrol went with them to Anvil. Ask at the port, Alan said he was going straight there."
"Ahh, I remember. The caravan did arrive. If you can call it a caravan! All Alan had left was a driver and one guard. He said that they were viciously attacked on the way."
"Alan released the guard and driver, paid them honourably even though most of the goods were lost. I rented him another warehouse for a day so that he could wait until the ship arrived for Leyawiin."
Well yes. Although... Wait a minute... But I don't remember Alan getting on the ship. I know for sure that he moved the wine from the warehouse. The next day the ship sailed.
"But I don't remember the goods being loaded onto the ship. Nine, help us! And in the logbook there was no entry, neither of Alan himself nor the goods."
"Has something happened to Alan? Ask around in the bay and look about too. By the will of the gods, everything will be fine. I'll tell the captain of the guard."
Alan killed? What a pity! Who could have done this? What dagger? Let me see.
"I have seen this engraving before! This is the coat of arms of Old Tobias. He once sailed on the [QUOTE]Jolly Octopus[QUOTE], then went bankrupt after some bad trades."
I haven't seen him in a while. Usually old Tobias is in the Fo'c's'le. The guards won't allow him to enter the city.
"Ask at The Fo'c's'le, if Tobias hasn't left the bay, surely he's settled there. Just watch out, be careful. A nasty crowd gathers at The Fo'c's'le."
Huh? What? Who... Get off me! What do you want?
"Huh? What? Who are you? What is a lass doing here? Hey, hey! Why are you grabbing a weapon like that? What do you want from me?"
"Who, me? Nothing! Hey, don't bother me. I don't know you! Get lost, I tell you! Do you want trouble? If I whistle, my men will pile on you instantly!"
"Well, not you, beauty! You look formidable, but I'm not afraid of girls. Oh! Ay! Quit that, you hear me! She's a mad girl! Yes, I understand, I, I understand, I'm stopping..."
"Give it here you scamp! Where did you get it? Okay, what do you want? Give it back, huh? This is my last memory of my father."
"Hey, give back the dagger, give it back now. Otherwise I'll call my men."
Hey you scamp! Where did you get it? This is my father's dagger. I've been looking for it for the last three days. Give it here.
"Hey wait. Wait a minute. Let's talk, huh? Well, what do you want? It's my dagger, yes. Like I say, mine. No guards needed. Where did you find it? I'll pay!"
"I swear by all the gods that I will pay. Do you want a hundred septims? More? Take two hundred. Two hundred twenty! No more! Oh, you scamp arse!"
"Well, what do you want, huh?"
"What is this? Listen, lass, you won't do it, don't fool me! They don't like the guards here. Don't go, what do you want from me? You don't want to give me the dagger, so tell me why you came?"
"Who is Alan? That wimpy wine merchant? Well, I didn't kill him. He showed off a lot here, got the attention of some important people. So they had him killed."
"I didn't kill him myself, I stood lookout. Left it to the younger men. Willie Splinter used my blade. I only gave him my dagger."
"Willie broke his blade when he poked something into a bottle. He swore loudly, then took my knife and cut Alan."
"They gave me money and told me to bring the goods down from the city, but I'm not a fool, I didn't obey. I'm staying here now."
"Hey! How do I know? Willie took the goods away with his friends. They said they would be taken to a ship, to some bloke who ordered Alan's death."
"They got into the boat at nightfall, and rowed away. And here I am... Hey! Don't kill me, eh? What am I? I just followed orders, and I stood watch. I did nothing."
"Let me go, huh?"
"Let me tell you how to get to the ship - there is a boat beside the crane. Tell the man [QUOTE]The parrot has arrived[QUOTE], and he will row you over."
"Leave me unharmed. I'm nobody, may Sheogorath kiss me passionately, if I lie!"
Who are you? They didn't tell me anything about you. How do you know the password?
"Old Stump! Well, you decide now. I'll take you, and then they'll either cut your head off or send you back. Are you going?"
Get on the boat.
Who are you? What are you doing here?
With the captain? Why would the captain talk to you? Who are you anyway?
"Oops! Friend, did you like our captain so much? Okay, go in. Only the cap is out of sorts today. So you have to work hard! Ha ha ha!"
"Suspicious somehow. Okay, go in, the cap will deal with you himself, if he wants. But look, don't do anything foolish. I will stand outside the door."
"Oh, you bugger!"
What? What cargo? How about a knife in your throat?
Blimey! My eyes are popping out! A woman! With weapons. I didn't drink that much... What cargo are you muttering about there?
"Oh, you, bossing me around! I'll teach you how to talk!"
What rubbish! I'll have to teach you a lesson. And then I'll let the rest of the crew have a turn too!
Is that so. Well... Ha! A thousand septims and the cargo is yours.
"Pretty woman, I'll give it to you for free. If I can bed you first? Gently. Or pay a thousand septims."
"Oh-ho-ho! Are you serious? You are brave! Okay, I'll throw off a couple hundred. Pay eight hundred septims. But you better keep silent about this!"
Are you serious? Okay. Just for the sake of your pretty face. Eight hundred septims and make me smile. Agreed?
"Good! Give me the money, I'll give you a key. Here you go, the wine is in that chest. Take it and get out!"
"Good! Give me the money, I'll give you a key. Here you go, the wine is in that chest. Take it and get out!"
Teasing girl!
"Fine, I'll take everything from you now. You're dead."
"What terrible news. My friend dead. We have been friends since childhood, our families were like relatives. Alan just got married and rebuilt the house."
"The rest of them I hardly knew, but, of course, I will send letters of condolence and compensation to their families. Gods! How unfortunate and ghastly it all turned out."
"Yes, I will help the families of the men from this caravan. I hardly knew them, but since Alan worked with them, then I must help them."
"That's hardly important right now... Although, of course, you were waiting for this wine. Please keep it for yourself. You helped me a lot and I cannot charge you anything for this order."
I hope that never again anyone attacks my men. I should report your help to Count Marius. Thank you again.
"That is hardly important right now. People are lost. My friend was killed, the whole caravan was killed. I must hire better guards. And I... Ah. But what can I say."
"Here, take this. It is a small price to pay for your help. I hope you are not offended? My losses are too large."
"Thanks to you, I can again send agents for rare wine and caravans for common goods. Of course, I'll bring another shipment of Shadowbanish Wine."
You can pick it up in a week. I'll hold it for you.
"You're joking? I have no people, no money, and the roads are full of bandits. What a time to make an order like this. Sorry, but I'm not taking more orders."
"Ah, my savior! Of course, of course, here's your order! Here you go."
"No, no. I don't want to hear anything about payment. The trading house and Count Marius compensated me for the loss, and then some."
"The count ordered that merchant caravans be provided with security from the guards of county Leyawiin. Of course, we pay for security services."
"But now we're not afraid of bandits, thieves, or anyone. So take some wine and thank you!"
The trading house has threatened to curtail trade in Leyawiin if attacks on our caravans continue.
The venerable Hlidara Mothril wrote to the Elder Council and the Chancellor sent a very rigid and instructive letter to the count.
"From now on, trade security is a primary concern for the preservation and prosperity of Leyawiin."
"You see how everything can turn around if you take advantage of the situation at the right time, and wisely."
"Thank you again. Come more often, I will always have discounts for you."
"Ah, you must have been sent to help me, yes?"
"People? Oh no, it's the rabbits! The Emperor's rabbits have been getting sick here in the Arboretum."
"That's right, the rabbits, and as Rangers, we're responsible for keeping them alive - the Emperor gave the guild this edict years ago, and even though he's now dead, we cannot disobey."
"So, here I am trying to find a cure. I want you to go out and try to find the cause. What is making the rabbits sick, can it be prevented? Off you go now, Associate."
Perhaps one of the guards will have some ideas.
"Yes, I've noticed some aren't looking so healthy. It's none of my concern however, I'm here to keep the peace, not to worry about some silly fluffy bunnies dropping dead."
They have been a little less energetic lately.
"Ask one of the other watchmen, and stop bothering me about it."
"There was a report of someone seeing a black rat near the pond one night, try looking around there."
No. I haven't seen anything out of the ordinary which could be causing them to become sick. You could try asking one of the other guards.
"Well, now that you mention it, I did receive a report the other night from a citizen, she said she'd seen a large black rat in the bushes by the pond."
I just thought it was probably someone's pet cat prowling around and dismissed it.
"If there are black rats in the Arboretum, then they must be coming up from the caverns beneath the city."
"If you're looking to earn some coin, you might also want to go see Seijfrid Quillus in the Tunnel Imperial Legion Checkpoint offices, once you've finished with the rabbit sickness."
"I believe there's a reward for bringing him dead black rats, as long as he's authorised you to go hunt them."
"Ah, yes that makes sense. Rats are known to carry diseases with them. If they've started hunting the rabbits, then they could easily pass something on and infect them."
Have you found where these rats are entering the Arboretum?
"Well you must find out how they are getting in and stop them. There is probably some small hole they are crawling through. Find that hole, and place a rock over it to block them from coming out."
One of the rocks beside the well just north of this hotel should be perfect.
"Then simply place something over it to block them from coming out. The obelisk opposite the fountain on the other side of the Arboretum would be perfect, and I think it may be loose on its base."
"Well, we can't all be super-strong, can we? Some of us are better at other things, like using our brains, or being sneaky."
"Not to worry, go through the door at the end of the corridor and find Alfhed, he'll have no problem carrying the obelisk to the hole."
"He was recently hit on the head during a bar-fight, so he's not too bright just now. Talk slowly and clearly, he'll understand."
"Um, okay?"
"Sure, I can do that. If Vienele says it's okay."
She said it's okay?
Okay. Where's the obelisk?
Okay?
Okay. It wasn't heavy.
Oh. Okay. You must be weak.
"I go now, okay?"
Okay.
"Very good. Now the rats won't be getting into the Arboretum, so there shouldn't be as many rabbits getting sick."
"Here, take this as a reward. Now I really must be getting back to trying to cure the rabbits who are already sick."
"As you complete the tasks assigned to you, you will gain recognition by the guild, advancing you through the ranks."
"You will be given tasks suited to your rank, so as you advance you can expect to receive tasks we would not trust to lower-ranked members."
A good start. I'll promote you to Apprentice for completing your first task.
"Well done, you are now promoted to the rank of Journeyman, keep up the good work!"
"You're making good progress now. I think it's time to promote you to the rank of Field Watcher, you have proven yourself reliable enough."
"Good work, I am pleased with you! I hereby give you the rank of Forest Guardian."
"You are rising swiftly through the ranks, you almost qualify as a true Ranger! But not quite yet... you now hold the rank of Assistant Ranger."
I am very impressed with your handling of all these tasks. I think it's time to give you true recognition. You are now a Ranger!
"I can't promote you any further, I myself am only one rank above you. Speak with Guildmaster Silverneck, and soon we shall be equals."
"The one from the Rangers Guild? Yes, she's upstairs, first room on the right after the dining room."
"I'm sorry, I deal with the accounts, you should ask Charles Dumaine. His office is just through that door at the back of the room."
"Please don't distract me, I'm so far behind on this paperwork! Speak to Charles Dumaine, through that door at the back of the room."
"Not my department. Go speak to Charles Dumaine, he should know. Through that door back there."
"If you want to file a complaint, you'll have to fill out one of those forms on Garrick's desk and he'll deal with it soon. No? Well then see Charles Dumaine, his office is just back there through that door."
Why are you bothering me? Go speak with one of the office drones downstairs.
"I wouldn't know about that. Until someone brings me some paperwork to file away in the archives, I never know what's happening in this company."
"And by the time I do get the paperwork, whatever it is has already happened several days ago."
Oh dear! A missing delivery you say? And you're sure it was one of ours?
"Yes, I remember. I gave you a letter to take to the captain of the Shining Topal, so you could join him in the search for the missing ship."
"I see. Let me check some paperwork... yes. Right. Right... well, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but it would appear that your delivery was one of those on the ship which is currently missing, the Tender Topal."
"The Tender Topal should have arrived here in Leyawiin a week ago, traveling from Archon in Argonia. That's where they were picking up your cargo to bring here."
"I was just about to send one of our other ships, the Shining Topal to search for the Tender Topal. If you were to join in the search you would find out where your cargo is more quickly."
Very good! Please take this letter to the Shining Topal and hand it to the captain.
"Thank you... finally, he's sending us to search for the Tender Topal! And it says here that you're to come too?"
"Very well. Head below decks and rest in one of the cabins, we'll be getting under way fairly soon."
I do hope there are some survivors. My sister was on the Tender Topal...
"What did you do with the potion I gave you before? Fine, I'll make another, but if you keep doing this I'm going to charge you."
"Thank the gods, the Nine heard my prayers! I thought the pirates had come back to finish us off."
"It was, yes. Now it's just a wreck."
"We were chased by pirates! They had two ships, we couldn't hope to fight them off, so the captain tried to outrun them. Unfortunately for us, an unexpectedly strong wind suddenly came in from the west, and we were blown onto this sandbank."
"The pirates just sailed in and took everything. They killed anyone who resisted, but left the rest of us alone."
"Except for Ephenee... they took her with them. Poor sweet thing, she'll be their play-thing now until she dies."
"They came from The Gap, that pirate haven somewhere out at sea, so they'll have taken her and the cargo back there with them. Nobody knows where The Gap is though."
"Please, take us back to your ship now, we need food and water!"
"Ah, I both feared and hoped it would be. Tell me, what happened?"
"And my sister? Ephenee was her name, is she one of the survivors?"
"To The Gap? Then she is as good as dead! Tell Barin to return us to Leyawiin, I cannot think straight right now."
"Then we set sail! Come on crew, weigh anchor, hoist the mainsail!"
"I see. This is most disappointing, it is so expensive to replace a ship. What of the cargo?"
"Even more costs! We may lose some clients over this, I must start sending out apologies straight away. Please inform the Rangers Guild that I will place a new order for wood from Archon before this day is ended."
"Hmm? Oh yes, that's important of course. Very good, so you rescued some crew, but not the cargo. Now they'll be expecting some compensation for the troubles they've been through."
Are you still here? Can't you see I'm busy?
Lost at sea? Are you sure?
"Didn't you have a look around for the wood? Perhaps it was still in the hold, or floating nearby?"
"Humph. I don't suppose there's any point in asking whether you chased after the pirates? No, I thought not. You have completed the task I gave you, so I thank you."
"Yes, I heard there was some development in that story. I didn't understand it all though."
"Well, all I know is that Lady Lucy Varian's husband was an ogre. I really don't see how that relates to her body being stolen though. Are these two stories related somehow?"
Hmm. What happened then? He killed her and had her corpse removed for some reason?
Ah. He was a friend of Lord Varian then.
Please explain.
"...Baron von Zarov is a vampire! By the Nine, that explains..."
"One of the oldest members of this community came one day to tell me that he saw the baron and that he was the spitting image of the former baron, supposed to be his grandfather or something."
"He even said that the baron recognized him, which I thought was impossible of course because the new heir had only just arrived in town."
"Some days later, we found the old man dead in his house with a face stricken by fear. It was some sort of natural death."
I mean there was no trace of anything on his corpse so we assumed he just got scared of something and died.
"We can never prove it but that would make sense if he is a vampire, wouldn't it?"
I guess he won't. Not in our lifetime at least. Have you reported this to the authorities?
I guess a vampire and an ogre among the lords of Skingrad is a bit hard to admit. Are they all monsters? Is our duke a Lich? Ahaha!
"And so far you found two monsters out of two. I understand how you must be feeling but I know the other lords and ladies. While some do not attend all the ceremonies at the chapel, they are all long-time residents of the Skingrad community."
"...Disturbingly, true enough..."
There is much to ponder but those are really disturbing thoughts. Let's never talk about it again shall we?
Blessings of the Nine.
"That has all been resolved now. If you happen to stumble upon any other crime in our good city, please tell the guards immediately."
I hope there is nothing else though. Right?
"Good, good. Thank you and goodbye."
Oh no! What about him?
"Ah hah hah! That's funny! Lord Varian is an ogre, the Baron von Zarov is a vampire. I guess the other lords are werewolves and liches... Ah hah hah hah!"
"Listen, I know you did a great service to the town on this terrible affair with Lord Varian but unless you have some proof, you must understand that I can't act on this even if you proved yourself before."
"This is not even a simple lord but a baron we are talking about. If the count has no heir and dies, he is the next in the line for the position of Count of Skingrad."
Terribly sorry but I need more than your word for it. So go get me some proof.
You are free to enter the baron's house for the time being until he returns from his business trip. You mustn't steal anything but only take proof of his culpability. And report to me directly.
"Well then, we shall wait here until there are funds to pay for the materials we require."
I'm looking for work and meanwhile I try to keep my uncle from the bottle. Thank you for asking.
I have found work! At the same house but with the new owner - Baldor's sister Lady Vivian Varian. She is far better than Lord... that ogre ever was!
Thank you for getting our town rid of him. no doubt I would have ended in his special recipes one day or another.
What? What is it you're saying?
Never heard that name. Who is he? Your master? Does he have an order in our shop?
"Sorry, remember what? Did he make the order with me? We have many customers you see. But surely I would remember if a baron had come into this place."
This is not the kind of shop the nobility like to frequent. Maybe he sent an aide or something. Was it you?
Then let me check his name with the register. I'm sure that if we have an impending order it will be in the books.
Oh really?
Not at all. Should I? When did we meet?
"Okay... I, er... I'm quite busy right now..."
Found any proof that he is a... what was it again? A werewolf you said?
"Oh yes, a vampire! So where is the proof?"
"Hmm. That's a bit convenient isn't it? Just after you accuse him of being another monster, any proof you might have found just disappeared?"
I'm not saying that you invented the story but nevertheless there is no proof so there will be no action against the baron. I hereby revoke your authorisation to enter his house.
Thank you for your cooperation and have a nice day.
"If you ever see my husband, send him my love."
Maybe I should just start my own gang.

It is a serious matter. We need more people to help us in these times of crisis.
"Cyrodiil needs to be protected from the attacks of the Oblivion realms and we can help secure roads, protect livestock from predators, and do everything we can to help the people who live here."
It is a serious matter. We need more people to help us in these times of crisis.
"Cyrodiil needs to be rebuilt after the attacks from the Oblivion realms and we can help secure roads, protect livestock from predators, and do everything we can to help the people who live here."
Then there is no time to waste. Here is a list of the potential recruits. There are two in each city so you can start here if you want. You'd better ask around town if you don't know where to find each candidate.
"You just need to ask them a few questions we have prepared for you. Then you will take your report to High Ranger Falwin in the Leyawiin guild house and, according to their answers, it will be decided who are the best recruits for us."
You'll need to promote the Rangers Guild and its purposes of course.
You can tell them about your prior missions if you like and tell them what we intend to do to preserve and protect Cyrodiil. We are a small dedicated group and we will do whatever we can to achieve our goal.
They are written at the end of the list of recruits. Go now and make us proud.
You want me to join the Rangers Guild? Why?
Thank you. But what does your guild do anyway?
"I see. Looks interesting. But I'd like to know more. Like, did you have any specific missions you can tell me about?"
"...You're joking, right? Very funny! Okay, but seriously, what have you had to do for the guild?"
"Oh that does sound good. Boats, pirates, desert islands. Helping people. I think I'd like to join a guild like that."
"Of course, please go ahead."
I'm just a regular citizen. Not sure I have any special skills that would interest a guild like yours. I guess I can handle myself in a fight. That might be why I was noticed by your guild?
Gods or Daedra. That's a difficult question. I guess each person can see benefit in worshiping the Gods or the Daedra. Its a big world...
"Never thought about that. If you think of Talos, I think they say he was human at the start and became a god, which is why they are called the Nine now. So I guess it is possible."
This attack on the Emperor and his sons was a tragedy. We must protect the country of course.
How many people are you recruiting?
So your guild is planning on expanding a lot?
So your guild is planning on expanding a lot?
How many guild members are there in Cyrodiil already?
How many guild members are there in Cyrodiil already?
So why do you need more recruits?
Well I want to know where and with whom I'm going. If I'm to be recruited I want to know how many people will become my brothers and sisters and if we can make a real difference in helping Cyrodiil. Wouldn't you?
So what do I do now?
So what do I do now?
So what do I do now?
Okay. I'll wait to hear from them. Thank you for the offer.
I'm willing to listen to everything you want to say!... As long as you buy me a drink!
Hey! I'm serious as a priest!... As long as you buy me a drink!
You're a good person! Now I will listen  to whatever you want... As long as my mug never gets empty!
But you don't understand! I listen better when my mug is full! I have this phobia you know. The one of an empty mug. Gives me nightmares! So... As long as you buy me a drink...
"Damn, you talk well. But I know a good wine we should taste. You should order it!"
I just wanted a drink!
You want me to join the Rangers Guild? Why?
Thank you. But what does your guild do anyway?
"While finding me must have taken you a while, I'm sorry to say I'm not interested. I've got what I need right here."
"I see. Looks interesting. But I'd like to know more. Like, did you have any specific missions you can tell me about?"
Hmm... I see. So you want me to save rabbits all around Cyrodiil... I'm afraid that won't do it for me.
"...You're joking, right? Very funny! Okay, but seriously, what have you had to do for the guild?"
"Oh that does sound good. Boats, pirates, desert islands. Helping people. I think I'd like to join a guild like that."
"Of course, please go ahead."
You want me to join the Rangers Guild? Why?
You want me to join the Rangers Guild? Why?

You want me to join the Rangers Guild? Why?
You want me to join the Rangers Guild? Why?
Oh a new guild eh? Don't we have enough of them already? And what good did they do while people were dying from the Oblivion attacks?
What are you talking about? Don't you have better things to do while people are dying around Cyrodiil?
Ooh shiny new guild recruiting! Come along people! We are going to be famous while people are still dying from the attacks on Cyrodiil!
"The city sure is big! If you're not familiar with the layout, it'd be easy to get lost."
That's nice of you isn't it?
You helped? How? by relieving the corpses of their money?
"Really? Your guild pretended to have done all the work while the guards watched you do it, right?"
Damn right I have. All these guildies roaming around like they're going to save Cyrodiil.
"If you really want to help, you should join the army. They are the ones organising the defences and protecting the people while guilds are a bunch of looters and opportunists looking for their next big score."
"Listen pal, I have nothing against you personally but I'm sick of the guilds pretending to help people while they only wait for the next easy job that will pay the most."
Guildies: Bunch of pretenders all of them! I'd prefer to join the army instead.
Damn you are clever! Now move along.
You took the words right out of my mouth!
Damn right! I'll go sign for the army right away!
I lived in this city all my life but I learned a great deal about Cyrodiil and now I'm ready to put all my knowledge to good use.
I can't say that I'm very handy with weapons but I know this country really well so I think I can help in organizing and planning.
I've spent all my youth in the army. They cut me loose because I didn't always agree with orders but I'm all good now.
I can take orders and help others as I was meant to. I'm still good with an axe and a shield so tell me where I need to sign!
"I'm a renowned hunter in this city. I know every corner of the woods and I am handy with a sword and a bow. I think I'm a good candidate, don't you?"
I study magic and alchemy. I know where to find rare roots which I can make healing potions with.
I know how to calm the beasts so they won't harm me and also know a thing or two about sneaking by goblins to get the plant I need. I guess I'm a good candidate right?
"When I was young my father taught me to defend myself with a staff. I wouldn't like to attack anyone, but I know how to put up a good fight if there was trouble."
"I like to wander around. See new places, meet new people. Also I like the calm and quiet of the woods. I can defend myself and I'm ready to learn more. So I'm already a ranger in my mind."
"I'm an Altmer as you can see and I have spent all my long life studying mother nature. I know more about the rivers, the caves, the beasts and the other inhabitants of Cyrodiil than I know about the cities and the men."
Of course I know quite well how to survive in any environment.
Life hasn't been easy on me. I learned very young how to survive by myself. I was sold as a slave when still a child and managed to escape after many years of enslavement.
I then learned how to fight and took my revenge on the slavers. I'm a survivor. And I guess I could pass along that skill.
I'm much more a scholar than a fighter. I have studied all sorts of subjects and mastered many. I guess my range of skills could benefit a guild with the objectives you mention.
"I was a priest once. I always believed in the Nine. But then my mother died from a fever, then my younger sister and none of my prayers ever helped them. I hate the gods and the Daedra all the same!"
One man's - or woman's - religion is his own. I won't answer that!
What did the Nine ever do for us? They stay in their temples doing nothing while the monsters invade our lands. They do nothing! You have to wonder if they even exist.
"On the other hand, the Daedra reward their followers with powers no one has ever seen before."
The Nine protect us and we must worship all of them during this time of crisis. Daedra worshippers are the cause of all this mayhem and should be killed and questioned after!
"Sometimes I wonder if the Daedra might be the wiser of the gods, but I pray to the Nine."
"Of course I pray to the Nine, but it never did me any good. Why does that matter to the Rangers Guild anyway?"
I do believe in the Gods of course. The Daedra are just despicable.
"I never prayed much. I believe in the gods of course, how else would we be here if not by their will. But I do not bother them and they do the same for me."
"Gods or Daedra, does it really matter? None of them are doing anything right?"
"They're probably not really gods at all. I got to thinking, maybe they're all just normal people like you and me, claiming to be gods so they can be worshipped and receive gifts."
Well of course! Just look at Talos the Dragonborn!
"Just because someone claims to be a god, does not make them one. It is the will of the people to grant someone godhood. If we as a people believe someone to be a god, then they become a god."
"My mum always told me, if you put your mind to it, you can become anything you want."
"Well, I don't see you or me ever being a god, but important people can become gods, like Talos did."
"See, you have to do something impressive, like conquering every province in Tamriel. Now that's worthy of godhood!"
"I think that the Tribunal answers that question quite nicely, don't you? And also proves that gods can fall. I heard that Vivec still lives in Vvardenfell somewhere."
Honestly no. If a man could become a God then it means the Gods are no better than the men and we know that they are.
"Simply put, it is only madness to think that possible. A man becoming a God? Heard about the toad who wanted to be a bull?"
That's ridiculous of course.
Of course not! As a scholar this very proposition is preposterous. A man becoming a God? What nonsense!
"I've spent my life working here in the city, and I never even thought of the people beyond the city walls. This Oblivion attack has really opened my eyes, and I want to do something to help now!"
"If the farmlands in the country have been destroyed by the daedra, there will soon be food shortages in the cities! I want to help ensure that people in the cities won't starve."
"Isn't that what the army is meant for? We pay all these taxes, why don't the Imperial soldiers clear up the mess? I guess they're not going to do it, so sure, sign me up and we'll do it for them."
"I heard that things aren't nearly as bad as was first reported. Things got exaggerated, and now everyone's running around claiming it's the end of the world."
"If people need helping, I'm there, but seriously, isn't everyone just making a lot of fuss about nothing?"
"Well, it's rather dangerous outside the cities. I'd very much like to help others, I'm just not sure..."
I hate to see all the damage that has been done across Cyrodiil. It would be good to be able to do something to fix that.
Of course I want to help. I don't know what I can do but if your guild has any idea on how we can do that then I'm willing to join their effort.
Well I have had many tragedies in my long years. This one sure strikes near the heart as the land is disfigured by those random gates to Oblivion opening.
Nature is hurt in the process and I'm willing to assist anyone who could propose to do something against that.
"I answered your questions, so what do we do now?"
Okay. I'll wait for it. Thank you for the offer.
You want me to join the Rangers Guild? Why?
You want me to join the Rangers Guild? Why?
You want me to join the Rangers Guild? Why?
You want me to join the Rangers Guild? Why?
You want me to join the Rangers Guild? Why?
Ah thank you. I will pass your reports on these candidates onto Guildmaster Silverneck. Anything else you want to add to these?
I guess the people who were sent to check on new recruits weren't doing such a fine job. I wonder how this alcoholic ever made it to the list.
"I shall investigate the matter and reprimand those responsible. Thank you, anything else?"
I see. Well we didn't ask them anything. They made it to the list because they showed potential. Now their unwillingness to join us was not foreseeable. Anything else?
"Ah you wonder why they were asked those questions and you weren't, right?"
"We didn't have to come to you, but you came to us, and you look like a seasoned adventurer. The candidates on the other hand are just citizens we saw as potential recruits for the guild."
They didn't look for us like you did. So we have to find a way to check them out.
These questions are a way to find out some clues about them and of course they will afterward receive training and be checked out to see if they really fit our little family.
You on the other hand have proven yourself three times now so there is no doubt you are a good recruit for us. Anything else you wanted to ask?
"Thank you then. You have done some excellent work for the guild here, I am sure that Guildmaster Silverneck will appreciate the time you put in to create these reports."
"Come see me in a few days, there should be another task for you then. Why not take the time to get to know the other guildmembers here in Leyawiin?"
"Your efforts for the Rangers Guild have not gone unnoticed. I have passed the report onto Culumani, a recently promoted High Ranger. Culumani shall choose the new recruits."
No idea who that is.
That name is not familiar.
It's not a familiar name.

"Marsh? He's gone diving, didn't you see the note he left on his house? His favourite spot is on a small island just north-east of Bravil, you should look for him there."
"Look to the end of this bar here, that's him drinking himself to death."

"Sorry matey, I don't know the fella."
"I know her, she's a passenger on the ship Night's Scream. You should be able to find a row-boat beside the path leading to the lighthouse, which you can use to row out to the Night's Scream."
No idea who that is.

Eraamion likes to eat at Vark's Tavern. That's just down the road from the stable.
He's most likely around here somewhere. Hey! Eraamion! Someone's looking for you!
"Eraamion has been here once, but he prefers Vark's Tavern. Just down passed the stable."
I've heard Eraamion hangs out at Vark's Tavern. It's over by the stables.
Vark's Tavern is down the road from the stable. I heard Eraamion likes to eat there.

Greysmark? He's probably at home right now. His house is on the docks.
I've heard that Greysmark lives down by the docks.
Greysmark... I've seen him around. I think he lives by the docks.
"I've seen Greysmark on the docks, I think he might live around there."
Greysmark is probably at his home on the docks.
"Greysmark at home. Yes, definitely at home. He lives on the docks."

That name is not familiar.

She's not easy to see. Or to get along with. Yilandria spends most of her time in the women's bath house.
Not even the Nine know of whom you speak!
I'm afraid I don't know who that is.
"Jurno? Sure, I know Jurno, he works here! That's his cot over in the corner of the room. If he's not here right now, he could be in the Arboretum District, or maybe the Arena. He loves to place a bet on the fights over the weekend!"
"Jurno! Jurno works as a bouncer for the Emporium Club! Through the Waterfront Tunnel, to the south-east corner! The Emporium Club is above the Emporium Trader's Shop!"
No idea who that is.

Urjabhi has never heard of this person.
But he has not seen this one.
I am afraid I am not acquainted with that particular individual.

Nope! Don't know 'em.

Upstairs. Upstairs!!
"Jurno kicked me out of the Emporium Club. Go through the Waterfront Tunnel, to the south-east corner."
"Jurno is employed at the Emporium Club as a bouncer. Direct yourself down the Waterfront Tunnel, toward the south-east corner. The Emporium Club is located above the Emporium Trader's shop."
"Urjabhi has seen Jurno at the Emporium Club. Go through the Waterfront Tunnel, to the south-east corner. It is above the trader's shop."

"Last time I saw Sylori, she was staying somewhere on the Waterfront. You could try one of the taverns, she's an awful cook so she tends to eat out."
"Miss Amatius can often be found on the Waterfront at one of the taverns. She's a terrible cook, so she tends not to eat at home."
"I once chatted her up at some tavern on the Waterfront. I was a bit drunk, so I don't really remember which one."
"Sylori is a bad cook and does not eat at home. Urjabhi has seen her on the Waterfront, perhaps check the tavern there."
"Ah Sylori, she is a terrible cook! She's probably having dinner out on the Waterfront somewhere."
"While this one was on the Waterfront he saw Sylori go into one of the taverns. N'dreia was very tired, he is sorry not to remember which one."
"Ah yes, Miss Sylori. I believe I saw her around the Waterfront on one of my strolls. A wise man would check the taverns. There's a rumour she's not exactly a qualified chef!"
"I've never heard of them, sorry."
No idea who that is.
That name is not familiar.
He does not know this one.
It's not a familiar name.
"Imarume often likes to visit the Page of Cups to chat with her friends, she's probably there right now."
"Imarume? She's probably upstairs, chatting with her friends."
No idea who that is.
That name is not familiar.
He does not know this one.
It's not a familiar name.
"Well, she could be at home right now, just beside the gate leading out to the castle. Waxwing likes to practice her archery sometimes, she may be alongside the castle path."
"As long as you're not with the watch, that's fine by me."
Then you have come to the right man; one with a sharp blade and a sharper memory!
"Speak, and I will consult the Nine!"
Oh? Who is that then?
Maybe I can help?
Make it quick.
"That is what you're paid for, after all."
Aren't we all?
"Well, out with it... who're you looking for?"
My wife's cooking scares away most people.
Lots of people ride on my ship. What's their name?
How can I help?
How can Yuri help?
Who is it you seek?
Who is it you are hunting?
And who would that be?
N'dreia sees many on these streets.
How can Larahiid help?
Jo'Rakha knows many.
Who are you looking for?
"Oh really, who are you looking for?"
Maybe I can help. Are they a cobbler?
Tell the captain of the guard that Peg Head sends his greetings.
A sharper blade is better anyway.
Do not test the Divines!
"Alright, I'll forget about it."
Alright.
Is that all?
Time is money. And you're wasting mine!
Whatever you say.
Don't waste my time!
Sure thing.
Quit wasting my time!
"Oh, you're a strange one."
If you say so.
You are a strange one!
That happens to me too.
You confuse Urjabhi.
"Fine, then."
I sometimes forget things myself.
Has the name slipped your mind?
Don't dry my scales!
You are puzzling to this one!
"Anything else for you, today?"
No offense to you but a mere Journeyman isn't normally given tasks from our guildmaster. We have a hierarchy and as guild leader of the branch of Leyawiin I should be the one giving you your tasks until you reach at least the rank of Assistant Ranger.
She didn't tell me. Khajiit are like that. They just tell you what you need to know and nothing else.
Don't get me wrong; I respect her as our leader. Did you know that the Rangers Guild of Cyrodiil was founded by her? She has been our master since the beginning. She comes from Elsweyr where she was a high-ranking ranger official.
Ahaha! Of course there are. There are rangers guilds in almost every province. Cyrodiil is one of the last provinces we set foot in.
"In the beginning, the rangers were all Khajiit. They have that instinct for the hunt. Also they were mostly a hunters guild to start with."
But the good they did in the wild caused repercussions in the cities and the officials learned to rely on the rangers to make the roads safer and keep the wild animals away from the farms and such.
But enough history. Go meet with her now. She is waiting for you. But...
"If you want to hear more about the guild history, I'm always here. So you can come talk to me any time you want."
Not now anyway. Go see Silverneck.
Not now anyway. Go see Silverneck.
Not now anyway. Go see Silverneck.
"Yes, I have a task for you. I read the reports on your recruiting mission and it looks promising. Several good candidates in it. But we also need to expand our bases in Cyrodiil."
We need a new guild house and I think I have found the perfect spot: Anvil.
But I do! You need to head to Anvil and seek an audience with the countess. Get her to grant the Rangers Guild a new guild house in their city.
I heard you are resourceful. Use your wits and charm.
We must not be denied. We are the only major guild not represented in all the cities of Cyrodiil.
"This makes us look like a minor guild. Explain what the guild is about and what we are doing to help people in Cyrodiil, and do whatever they ask you."
"Yes, we have funding. Any price - as long as it stays reasonable of course - should be covered."
"But if you do your job well, maybe we will be granted a guild house for free, as it would be an honour for them to have our guild in their walls."
Ranks do not matter. What matters is the dedication of a person. The will to accomplish something good. And you seem strong-willed. Are you not?
Then you have everything we need for this task. You should not fail us...
Hmm. I have never heard of them. So you are their representative?
So what does your guild send you for?
Ahahah! Aren't you presumptuous! Like I said I have never heard of your guild. So how do I know you're not a bunch of lowly thieves trying to get a foothold in my city?
And that should convince me?
"Listen, if your guild really has only good intentions as you said, then we might work something out."
I have heard of your own personal exploits in Cyrodiil. It isn't that I do not want to take your word for it but it is not that simple.
"Listen, if your guild really has only good intentions as you said, then we might work something out."
"Since the disappearance of my husband, some groups are pushing their boundaries to see how much they can get away with."
So far I have been patient and accommodating but I grow tired of their recklessness.
"Since the recent return of my husband, we have been a little distracted. Some groups are pushing their boundaries to see how much they can get away with."
So far I have been patient and accommodating but I grow tired of their recklessness.
The pirates of course!
"Yes, you may have seen their boats in the bay. One of them even took a docking place and never left. I think they have settled in a tavern nearby and even had the owner rename it and place their flag on the walls."
"It's time to act. And, you and your guild, if you want to have some place to stay in my city, will have to help."
"It's time to act. And, you and your guild, if you want to have some place to stay in my city, will have to help."
"It is time to act. And, you and your guild, if you want to have some place to stay in my city, will have to help."
"Well, you know their type. You will ask them to leave, they will refuse and then you'll have to fight them to make a point."
"If you win, then you'll prove your worth to this city and I will consider one of our unoccupied houses for your guild to settle in."
"Well you do as you want. I just want all of them to be gone. All three ships! If you can convince them to go, good for you. If you prefer to just murder them all, I don't care. Just as long as you get the result I want."
"It is your guild which is trying to get in my good graces. The guards have other duties like making sure the merchants are not bullied by the pirates, the citizens are not submitted to any racketeering from them, the women are not raped and so on."
"It has become a full-time job. And I prefer to have them protect the people of my city instead of just putting in jail their murderers, rapists and extortionists."
"I'm sure you do. Sink the two ships out at sea, but not the one docked - I don't want a wreck right here on the docks."
"Now if you'll excuse me I have other matters to attend to, unless there is something else you want to talk about?"
"Then what are you waiting for? The Rangers Guild I'm sure is eager to get this new guild house, is it not?"
Then get on with it. Remove those three boats from my bay.
Learn to swim!
So you demand the right for Parley? Are you a pirate?
"You'll speak to Captain Hawkins alright! But you do not speak like a pirate, so you'd better stop your nonsense about parley, savvy?"
"Go to the Black Flag Tavern, he's having a drink and getting friendly with the barmaid."
"You will speak to Captain Hawkins alright! But you do not speak like a pirate so you'd better stop your nonsense about parley, savvy?"
"Go to the Black Flag Tavern, he's having a drink and getting friendly with the barmaid."
I heard we do. What do you want with the mighty captain Hawkins? Wanting to become a pirate yourself heh?
Huh? Then what do you want? This better be good 'cause I have no patience.
What? And who are you to tell us to go? A better one yet: You and whose army?
"If it's a war you want, a war you shall have mate!"
"If it's a war you want, a war you shall have mate!"
"If it's a war you want, a war you shall have mate!"
"What? Did I say something funny? Make a joke of my sales pitch, and you'll end up like the last fool..."
"He wound up in the river, along with all the other scum that comes out of that city..."
"You're damn right! My father taught me well... he was a Blade, after all..."
"Yes, what of it?"
"Because it's what I'm passionate about, I'm not into fighting like my father..."
I'm willing to make exceptions...
"Well, don't be a stranger."
"He's a regular here at my tavern... I'd call him a customer, but he never pays."
"I'd throw him out, but I've seen the hovel he calls a home... I just don't have the heart to do it."
"Hey, I heard you bought Finn's place to help him pay his tab... you're alright..."
"I know a fellow thief when I see one, we're like brothers and sisters..."
"You need anything, you just ask..."
"Oh, and if you ever need a place to stay, maybe wait until the heat dies down, there's a place across the river..."
Just look for the rope near the Bravil Cobbler and Tailor...
You don't even know the start of it...
"With the way the people of this city go through their soles, you'd think they all ran marathons on broken glass..."
"Oh... Ashirani was sure... nevermind, you look, maybe you like, and you buy..."
"Heh, you're too kind... it's all just junk, so no matter how I sort it, it'll still look like a mess..."
"But, hey, you might get lucky, and find something useful among all the rubbish..."
"So, you found something you like yet? Hey, if you happen to find my mother in here, just yell out! I lost her about a week ago, and I haven't been able to find her in this mess since! Ha ha! Don't worry, that's just a little joke..."
"The poor beggar over there, on the other rock..."
I'm pretty sure he's dead... I don't have the heart to go look...
"...worst part is, he owed me three septims..."
"Ahh, a fellow thief, eh? Well, make yourself comfortable..."
"If you need to store any... goods... until the heat goes down, there are some empty smuggling crates downstairs..."
"Don't worry, we're honourable! We won't take anything that you've... acquired..."
"I hear the city is ripe with fresh marks, just ready for the picking..."
"Oh, I didn't realize... well, pull up a seat and get comfortable..."
I don't get much business these days...
"Most of the mines around here have already been stripped bare, and those that haven't are overrun with goblins..."
"There isn't much of a demand for my wares anymore, not in these parts..."
"Naqvi is more than just an alchemist, she is the finest alchemist in Tamriel!"
"Why, just yesterday Naqvi achieved her most recent goal of transforming a potato into cheese!"
...
"...no, it did not..."
"You smelled the sweet smell of quality meat as you passed by my door, didn't you?"
A finer selection of fresh meat you won't find anywhere else! Beef! Ham! Mutton! I've got it all!
...is... what...
"Oh, that?! No, of course not! That's just... one of my secret spices that add to the already magnificent flavour of -"
"I assure you, it isn't! Alright, I'll tell you, it's an Ironwood Nut! But, you mustn't tell my secret to anyone -"
It... just... flew...
"Okay, listen you! You tell anyone about this, and I'll cut you like a box!"
Rahjiid smells good for a Khajiit! You should smell his wife after a few days without a bath.
Mama tells me not to talk to strangers...
"I don't really care what it's called, all I care about is finding a cure for - <cough-COUGH-COUGH> - ... for it..."
"Sure, sure... I'll be fine... just as soon as everything stops moving..."
"I can't calm down! Not now! Not soon! Not even later! They won't let me! The little men! It's never quiet, they're always yelling! Yelling in my head!"
"It is a refuge for those who bear the mark of disease, a safe haven for them to recover from their debilitating illnesses..."
"Well, someone has to care for them, supply their medicines and herbs, and look after their general well-being..."
"There is always the chance, but I swore an oath a long time ago to care for those less fortunate than myself..."
"So, in a way, looking after these people is my duty in life..."
"Oh yes, I could sense your aura from miles away..."
You have one of the most powerful auras I have ever felt...
"You are destined to do many, many great things..."
"Hmmm... your aura is bright, but it is also unclear..."
Your destiny is still unwritten...
The path you take from here is entirely up to you...
"Whether you will walk the path of light, or the alleyway of darkness, is unknown..."
"You are not guided by fate, instead, fate is guided by you..."
That is up to you to discover...
"Oooh, a chef never reveals her secrets..."
"Mmmm, it smells so good... maybe I should add some bergamot, just to add a little more flavour..."
"Unfortunately, no, not like my sister Luciana..."
"I've tried to lead a more honest business than her, but in a place like this, it's not very popular..."
Perhaps I should just start dealing in stolen wares like her...
"Oh, er... probably shouldn't have told you that..."
"My wife once tried to bake sweet rolls. They were flat... they weren't sweet... I think it was like a new type of thing, there was meat on there, some sort of red sauce... cheese, I don't know... she called it a sweetroll, I think she's blind."
"Her pottage stew tastes like a Khajiit's wet backside, only with more hair!"
I was stupid enough to taste her Surprise Hotpot. I'm still picking feathers out from my teeth.
"Hey mister, want to play Elite Shadowscale And Dishonest Businessman with me?"
"Hey lady, want to play Elite Shadowscale And Dishonest Businesswoman with me?"
"You turn your back, and I come up behind you and stab you in the neck!"
Awww...
My son Samuel... he's dead...
"He was always protective of me, ever since his father died..."
"We don't have much money, so... he tried to steal some food for us... for me..."
"The guards caught him, and as an example, they publicly hanged him..."
"That's him out there, hanging from the gallows..."
Oh Samuel...
"What? No! I mean, yes! Yes! Help, that's what I need! And you can give me that help! Seriously, just, okay... three septims! Please!"
Yes! Skooma!
"Wait, no! No, not skooma! I won't spend it on skooma! Skooma is baaaaad, very, very bad! I won't buy skooma!"
"Shoes! I'll spend it on shoes! Shoes are good, right? With shoes, I can walk, and if I can walk, I can run! Run! Running is good too!"
"Come on! Surely two septims isn't much! And it's for good! The shoes, remember?!"
No! No! You can't leave! You're a good guy! Good guys don't leave! Don't leave! Please! One septim! One! That's all I need! Please!
"Then, when the blood runs, the ground is drenched in scarlet life, and the light darkens as death approaches you and wraps you in his cold embrace..."
"Death will then hold you tight as he carries you to the plains of despair where you will writhe for all eternity, surrounded by the moans of anguish and terror of the innocent!"
"Run if you wish, but the blade will always find its mark, and death will always be one step behind you, waiting for you to stumble and fall, thrashing into the void of his world..."
"I unload cargo from the ships that moor here in the port. It's hard work, and it doesn't pay much, but work is difficult to find these days, so I cherish every moment of it."
It's not something I like to talk about...
"Well, if you're going to be persistent about it..."
"One day I was moving crates, but they were so big, I couldn't see where I was going..."
"Next thing I know, I lose my footing, and I fall right into the outhouse cesspool..."
"I was originally named something a bit less family friendly, so they kindly softened it to Albin the Slime..."
"But only because they were yelling it across the dock, and the captain kept smacking them across the head for doing it in front of the kiddies..."
"Hey, you're alright..."
"Sure, that's what they all say... you don't have anything to worry about, you're full, you have somewhere under a roof to sleep tonight..."
"Some of us don't have it as good as you do, you know..."
"Oh, plenty o' good stuff! At the moment, we specialize in exporting large amounts of Nunaya!"
"As in, none o' ya business! Now get lost!"
"That's what makes it so good! Soft-skins are always afraid of the filth, so I get the whole bay to myself."
"She's battered the roughest seas, and always come out on top! There were some times I thought she wouldn't make it, but she did... she's my pride and joy..."
"We export goods from Cyrodiil to the western coast of Hammerfell, and even all the way to Nalonga in the Sea of Pearls, far to the west..."
"You look like a hardy one, care to become a part of my crew? It doesn't pay well, but you get your board and food for free, and you get to see the world..."
"Ohh, one of my favourites; Offal stew! First, I take the brains of a deer, and I put them in a pot, where I then add the kidneys of a rabbit, and then boil it all together with the blood of an ox, and then I -"
What? Why? It's a perfectly good meal! Makes you strong! Staves off seasickness too...
"Makes you sick now, so you don't get sick later! BWAHAHAHA!"
"Pinot and I play cards on a regular basis, and every time I win big, he never pays up!"
"Sure, I don't care, do whatever you have to, just squeeze those coins from that cheap-arse and get my money!"
"About time too! I don't care what he says, I ain't playing cards with him anymore..."
"What did you do?! Why did you go and kill him over a few lousy coins! Get away from me you maniac, I want nothing to do with you!"
Then why are you talking to me?!
Well what a waste of time you were then!
"I don't owe that cheating s'wit anything! He says he beat me, but he only did because he kept cards hidden in his sleeves!"
"Fine, take the damn gold! It doesn't matter, I'm never playing with that stupid fool again!"
"If you think I'm going to pay that fool, you're as stupid as he is!"
"On route to different ports, if any pirate is stupid enough to try and attack our ship, I'm the one that deals with them... but I've built up enough of a reputation that they don't try anymore..."
"Well, I usually host a game of Liar's Dice during the evenings when I've finished work."
"It's a pretty simple game, but I have to warn you, I'm a mean player..."
Just last night I won fifty septims off the cook...
"Although, I think he may have spat in my morning broth at breakfast."
"He's named Fer! I'm trying to teach him the ways of the captain, so that one day I may be able to retire with a sense of hope that my business will continue without me."
But he's as good at grasping the concept of being a captain as he's good at growing wings and flying away!
"He wants me to take up his position of captain when he retires, but he doesn't think I'm up to it. All he does is point out my flaws, and then barks at me about them."
"If he thinks I'm so useless, why doesn't he just give up, and let me get on with my life?"
"Yes, it's my job to see that the horses get only the best care on their journey to their new homes."
"Oh very much so! I've been tending to horses since I was young, and I wouldn't do anything else."
I actually owned my own horses back when I lived in Valenwood... riding along on the back of a majestic steed while I traveled across the emerald fields.
"But... that was then... I've grown up, and I need to start taking responsibility, so I got a job as a stablehand on this ship."
"I do all the cooking and the cleaning, do the washing and scrub the floors, and do I hear a single word of thanks? Of course I don't!"
That terrible excuse for a man wouldn't last three days without me! Makes me wonder why I don't just get up and leave one of these days.

And there just so happens to be a fine vessel moored at the port at this very moment...
Perhaps I should pay the captain a little visit during the night...
Wait... am I still talking out loud?
"You breathe a word of this to anyone kid, and you're going to be fish bait!"
"I can talk to anyone anyway I like, and no worthless barnacle like you is going to stop me."
"I've taken on men far stronger, faster and smarter than you can even imagine, and I've always come out on top."

What could a pathetic nothing such as yourself do to help me?
...
"Then again, maybe you could be of use. I am searching for... a brother of mine."
"He used to live near Bravil, but I'm having trouble locating him. He lived in a shack, to the north-east of the city."
"But he has since relocated, and didn't bother to inform me. I think a friend of his, who lives nearby, knows where he is."
"Find out where he is, and I could give you a few coins."
"Then what are you doing standing here, talking to me? Get to it!"
Where?
"Ahh, excellent, our... mother... will be pleased. Here, take these coins for all your hard work."
"Ahh, excellent, our... mother... will be pleased. Here, take these coins for all your hard work."

"Help? You want to help me? Fine, yeah, I know how you can help."
"Convince my damn tenants to pay their rent, and I'll give you a quarter of what they owe me. They're Cassus, Mina and Denwin."
"The natural order of the world shall be maintained. With payments made, the disturbances cease, and the blood may flow."
"Yes! No! I need money for hats, not for gro-Ghra. Lots of big hats to keep the sun from my eyes. From your eyes too!"
"Wait, gro-Ghra is big... oh no no no, mustn't anger gro-Ghra! No skooma this week... Must pay gro-Ghra... You're a good friend, lend me two septims for gro-Ghra?"
"Yes... yes, you're right of course. I mustn't forget to pay or I'll have nowhere to live. Samuel used to provide money for me..."
"The longest cut bleeds the fiercest, and the deepest cut bleeds the swiftest."
"Well I'll be damned, finally, a useful person in this rat hole of a city! Here, a quarter of what they owed me, as promised."
"Then stop standing here gawking at me, and get to work! You said you wanted to be helpful, so get to it! Make Cassus, Mina and Denwin pay up!"
"Well, you definitely don't look like the seafarin' type. So, what can I do for you? Oh, I know, you must be the one Wolfe sent to get her supplies for her."
"Here, take them, but be careful, they're heavy! Just take them back to Wolfe, and get the gold she owes me for it."
Oh? I thought Pinot was going to collect that. I'll take it now... it's not as heavy as I was expecting.
"I've been watching the seas all day, boats coming in and going, and nothing but dry-scales and no tail to look at."

"I haven't sold a painting in over a year! I'm reduced to eating rotten food, and I haven't bathed in a month!"
"You... want to help me? That's very kind of you, but I don't really know how you could..."
"Wait, I have an idea!"
"Please, take these sketches! Hand them out to fifteen people around Bravil, and see if they like them or not! Perhaps if I had a bit more exposure, more people would want to buy my art!"
"Oh... well, you know, take your time... I'm not going anywhere."
"I knew it! I knew you'd do it! I've already had three orders for paintings, and I heard rumour of another two coming this evening! Thank you so very, very much!"
"Please, I made this painting especially for you! I hope you enjoy it!"
"Thank you. This one has heard of Eugene, doesn't he live in Bruma?"
"Thank you. I've heard of Eugene, doesn't he live in Bruma?"
"What is it supposed to be, a cow? A horse? This one cannot tell!"
"What is it supposed to be, a cow? A horse? I can't tell!"
This is a little too abstract. It doesn't look like anything.
This looks like a stew I made recently.
I've seen better looking mud crabs!
"This is amazing, right away Azzhad recognises the location!"
"This is amazing, I recognise this location straight away!"
"Azzhad will look at it later, he cannot see without his glasses."
I'll look at it later.
"I'll look at it later, I'm a little busy right now!"
I will take a closer look after my swim.
"It's rather dark, isn't it?"
Oh how revolting! Azzhad cannot believe you are handing this out to everybody you meet!
Oh how revolting! I can't believe you are handing this out to everybody you meet!
My wife's cooking looks better than this!
"Oh, how horrible! The guards let you hand this out?"
Oh how disgusting! They let you hand this to people?
Some of the filth they dump in this bay looks better!
Where's the color? It's just outlines.
"The legs are disproportionate to the rest of the body, and the neck is too long. This artist needs more practice."
"Those are some long legs and short arms, don't you think?"
These proportions are terrible. This artist needs more practice.
I've seen a lot of people on this ship. None of them look like... that.
Oooooh! It moves!
"Thank you. This one doesn't get it, but perhaps Rahjiid doesn't understand art."
"Looks like they need a little practice, nobody's arms are that long!"
"That's right! The city is crawling with those damn thugs, and I caught three of them, single handedly! One tried to convince me he wasn't a part of the group, just because he was a Khajiit."
"But I know better! It was just a ploy to make me think he isn't a part of them! If he wasn't, why was he in the area when those thugs robbed that store, hmmm?"
None of your business! Don't go prying your nose where it doesn't belong!
"Oh, a lovely gentleman from across the road has invited me over to his home for a meal... but, it's so embarrassing, I've never done this before."
I most certainly was! I was the finest swordsman to grace this beautiful land in my day! No bandit nor wild boar would stand in my way of glory!
"I used to plunder a fort ruin or two in a single day, sell my spoils, and then partake in fine drink and food for a week!"
"But, well, that was back when I was a much younger lad, and those days are far behind me... but, I still remain as skilled with a sword as ever! You should never let a good talent waste away, you would do well to remember that in your twilight years."
"I'm sick of my wife, that's what! She drives me mad with all the little things she does!"
"She leaves all of her scraps on her plate to rot, I have to always pick her clothes up off the floor, she never soaks her paint-covered aprons, and I have never once seen her with a broom in her hand."
So what if I play a prank or two on her? It's about time she felt the annoyance I feel every blasted day!
"That idiot husband of mine, Meden! I can't stand being in his presence any longer! I don't care if we're in wedlock together, I'll just have to unlock it!"
"He keeps doing the most irritating things imaginable! At the moment, his choice of annoying me involves repeatedly hiding my grandmother's ring!"
"His childishness has no bounds, and I just cannot take it any longer! But don't worry, it won't last, I'll make sure of that."
The countess will not tolerate a mass murderer in her city.
Stop right there. You are to go to jail pending your judgment. Do not try to resist or we won't hesitate to kill you on the spot.
But of course! Like the rest of them. And you certainly didn't go on a murder spree among the sailors of the bay right?
Whatever. Put this criminal in jail now!
Whatever. Put this criminal in jail now!
Whatever. Put this criminal in jail now!
"Anywhere that is willin' to pay the right amount of gold! We sail as far east as Branchmont in Black Marsh, all the way to Woodhearth in Valenwood!"
"We ferry the poor all across the southern coast o' Tamriel! Some folk can't afford the high life of ordinary shipping lines, so we take them instead in bulk at a highly reduced rate!"
"Aye, aye, I got me a cure for hangovers right 'ere... only problem is, it tastes worse than fish guts left out in the sun fer a week."
"Mah lucky Cliff Racer Feather! I never go to sea without it! It's gotten me through the worst storms yeh'd ever seen! If I go without it, we'll all be dashed to pieces for sure!"
"Oh aye, yeh'd do that for me! Oh, you're a right sort, arn't yeh! Oh, that takes a weight off mah shoulders! I got that feather from a trip to Morrowind, I did."
The last place I saw it was down in Passenger Quarters o' the ship! It can't have gotten far.
"Well, mind yeh don't wander off the wharf an' wind up in the drink! I ain't fishin' yeh out!"
"Oh, aye, yeah, it's harder than it looks, innit? I looked fer days and I couldn't find the bugger... maybe I'll just have teh go teh sea without it."
"Oh heck! That's fantastic! I'd be lost without it! I can't thank yeh enough! Here, a bottle o' hooch I've been savin' fer a special occasion! The guy who gave it to me said it was rare an' expensive, but all I cared was that it tasted good!"
"I sure do! Since I'm right on the dock, I get plenty of hungry and thirsty sailors through here every night! The only problem is dealing with them when they've drunk a bit too much."
"Oh, no, sorry, you haven't done anything, I'm just so bored, the ship hasn't left port in weeks."
"I'm working! Something I can clearly see you know nothing about! Now, begone! Where was I... blast it! I'll have to start all over again!"
"Very well, just don't make a mess or bother any of the other clerks."
"My brothers and I built this company, and the workload was supposed to be shared equally! But instead Charles and I do all the work, while that lazy bastard Alexander reaps all the rewards."
"I should just dip my hand into the company coffers until I get enough to retire comfortably on Stirk, and leave that fool to the company he has no idea how to run."
"Oh don't give me that look, it's well known that Alexander has his hand in the honeypot on a daily basis!"
What? You've never heard of the Topal Trading Company? It's probably the largest independent shipping company in Tamriel!
"We ship goods all across the continent from this very port! Only the East Empire Company is larger, but then they're funded by the Imperial coffers."
You must live under a rock if you've never heard of it... or maybe it's just you don't have the coin to pay for any of our services.
"The Numidium, one of the finest vessels sailing on the ocean! She's fast, agile, and strong, everything a fighting vessel should be! And you really shouldn't be on board."
It's one of the finest ships in the Imperial fleet! The Numidium ferries us to locations that need the Empire's strength and courage in battle at lightning-fast speed!
"What it is is off limits to unauthorized personnel! So unless you have the papers stating you can be here, I think it's best that you leave."
"This is The Numidium, one of the finest ships in the Imperial armada! And you have no reason to be here, so leave, now!"
This fine ship is what takes us to foreign lands to help maintain the peace in the other provinces!
"Without it, we'd have to go on foot, and even though our training is strenuous, even that is a bit of a stretch of our abilities."
"What, you mean this ship? It just takes us from place to place, whenever we're deployed to help fight some war."
"Which is great, because it sure beats the hell out of marching all the way there."
"This is no ordinary ship! this is The Numidium, one of the greatest ships in the entire Imperial fleet! And access is granted only to those who have sworn allegiance to the Empire, so leave immediately!"
Off limits! Now go!
"It's what ferries us all around Tamriel to the places we are deployed to help maintain the peace! Frankly, I don't think anything we do has anything to do with peace."
"To me, it just seems like we're trying to assert the authority of the Empire, and to put everyone who feels they may like to rise up against us in their place."
"The Numidium is an Imperial Navy Fleet Vessel, one of the many used in the deploying of Imperial Legionnaires to the battlefield in other provinces."
"At the moment, we don't have any orders, so we're docked here in Leyawiin. We continue to train, but our time is our own."
"I'm so glad you enjoy it, after all, it was built entirely just to impress you! I'm so happy, I may have to burn it down and build another one, just to see if you like that too."
"Well, how do you expect me to address some vagrant that has just walked in off the streets, bringing the filth in with them on their shoes, right into my private estate?"
"Very well, I will... how are you? Are you well? Would you like a drink, or perhaps something to eat? Are you tired? How about a bed?"
"Oh wonderful, that does warm my heart... is there anything else you need?"
"I'm a collector of fine literature... just in case you don't understand, that means books."
"I have an entire study full of them, and I plan on widening my collection in the foreseeable future."
"My wife, on the other hand, is quite handy around the stove... whenever she's not out shopping for fresh ingredients, something that is so very hard to find in this squalor of a town, she's baking in the kitchen."
"I'm sure if you ask her nicely, she'll give you something to eat... she tends to be quite charitable to those who clearly are in need of it."
"Now, if you don't mind, while this conversation is absolutely riveting, I have better things to do, such as bathing... I wouldn't expect you to understand."
"Oh, you are a kind one, aren't you? Is there something I can get you? A drink, perhaps? Or are you hungry? I've just finished baking a whole batch of fresh bread, would you like some?"
"Oh please, don't give it a second thought! Make yourself comfortable, we have more than enough room to share... just don't track any mud on the rugs, or else Marc will burst a blood vessel again."
"Oh no, this is the fine work of my lovely wife Frehja! She most certainly does a fine job, doesn't she? Such a wonderful woman, Larahiid doesn't know what he'd do without her."
Isn't that right my little kitten?!
Nonsense!
She is yelling simply to express how much she loves Larahiid!
"Eh, eh heh... this one thinks perhaps it is time to put some soundproofing around the kitchen door, no?"
"While he's off lounging around, Frehja is working her claws blunt to keep up with the demand! She even needed to take on an apprentice just to stay out of the water!"
"Farus may be new to the profession, but he is a fast worker, a hard worker too! Without him, Frehja simply would not be able to do it."
"Then again, it wouldn't hurt to have Larahiid get his lazy tail into the kitchen and do some work for once!"
"I don't like to let on, but I have a big soft spot for animals! Big, small, fluffy or feathery, I love them all! They're just so cute."
"I don't know if you've seen him yet, but that big grey loveable wolf Scruff? He's mine! I rescued him from a mean peddler a few years back."
"When I found him, he had large patches of fur missing from him, and he was so skinny you could see his bones! It took a while, but I got him back to full health again."
"Now, he's healthy and as happy as ever! And being a part of the Ranger's Guild means that I can look after even more sick and injured animals, and maybe pound some sense into people who made them that way."
"Why else? To protect the fine balance of nature, of course! Terrible things are happening out there, and to keep the peace, nature needs our help!"
"Where I come from, it has been urbanized to the point where grass doesn't even grow anymore! Instead of greens and reds and pinks, all I had were browns and greys, and I couldn't stand it."
"I joined the Rangers Guild to do my part in preventing that from ever happening again! Towns can be pretty, and we need them to survive, but that doesn't mean we need to destroy the land in the process."
"Instead, we need to embrace the earth, and incorporate it into our lives! After all, without it, we'd all be dead."
"I wasn't always a law abiding citizen, you know! Up until only a short while ago, the streets were my home, that is, anytime I wasn't rotting in a cell in a castle dungeon."
"The last time I was caught, it was only for a minor pickpocketing charge, so instead of serving my time in prison, I was offered the chance to volunteer for the Rangers Guild."
"At first, I thought it was a load of hogwash! All those nature-loving brats, fawning over every little shrub like it was a newborn baby."
"But over time, I came to realize that there is much more to it! Protecting the fine balance of nature is a big job, and it is very rewarding! So, I forgot my life of petty crime, and became a full-time member of the Guild."
"The Rangers Guild has been in Tsava's blood since before Tsava was born! Tsava's entire family have been members, dating right back to when they still resided in Elsweyr."
"We are people of nature, one with the animals and the trees! We protect not only nature with our actions, but ourselves at the same time."
"If we do not live alongside nature, our society will surely crumble around us! Our jobs are as important as the Imperial Legion's is, but instead of dealing with people, we deal with the environment."
"Tsava is pleased to be a part of such a noble cause, and it warms Tsava's heart to see new members feel the same way as Tsava does."
I'm afraid that's a story I still feel great shame over...
"You see, before I joined, I was employed in a logging company in Valenwood... we had a quota, and it was our job to do whatever it took to meet it."
"We cleared so many forests, not even caring for the lives of the animals we destroyed in the process... all that mattered was the gold in our pockets, and the drink in our bellies."
"Then, one day, I found a small, wounded forest creature. I don't know why, but I felt strongly attached to the little thing."
"I nursed him back to health, and then set him free back into the area I found him in."
"...then one day, when we were clearing another area of land... I found him again... only this time, he was dead."
"...in our rush to clear the area of trees, the little creature's home was crushed by falling logs... logs we felled ourselves without a second thought."
"I left that company soon after, and never looked back... it was then that I first heard about the Rangers Guild."
"Without hesitation, I signed up, and I've never had doubts about my decision since."
"Well, originally, I was a porter for the Fighters Guild in Bravil, but that was several years ago."
"Not only did I allocate jobs to other members, but I also went on many myself."
"Most jobs consisted of wiping out a clan of goblins, or maybe empty a basement of rats... they all felt like I was doing the same thing, over and over again."
"All the senseless killing never got me anywhere! I'd kill a caveful of trolls, but a week later, it would be infested again! I could no longer see the point in what I was doing."
"That's when I learned about the Rangers Guild... instead of killing every creature that bothered someone, I learned to manage them, and that we can coexist with them instead."
"Simply killing creatures won't make our situation better, it will only make their lives worse! The Rangers Guild taught me that important lesson, and I doubt I'll be forgetting it anytime soon."
"Oh ho, can't you tell? I'm blind! It's okay, really! It's not a big deal, it happened a very long time ago anyway."
"My dear friend Edrik and I got caught in an ash storm in Vvardenfell many years ago, and we both copped an eyeful of the horrid stuff."
"The healers in the Rangers Guild in Morrowind tried desperately to save our eyesight, but it was no use, the damage had been done."
"I'm alright with it though, I still get by without my eyes, and they were lost while I was on blight patrol, so I at least lost them for a worthy cause."
"Oh, heh, sorry, I forgot, you're new! You see, I'm blind! So is my good friend Meadowdark! We both came here from Morrowind."
It's absolute hell over there! Trying to return the balance of nature back after the blight is one heck of a job.
"But, they've got a lot of good members over there, and we were told that Cyrodiil was lacking decent numbers, so we came here to lend you guys a hand."
"Heh, there's more to using a bow than just your eyesight! You listen with your ears, and you feel the vibrations in the ground with your feet."
Good to hear! We like to treat every member of the guild as though they were a brother or sister.
"If everyone gets along fine, we'll get a lot more work done, and we'll get it done faster and more efficiently too."
Rahaq is happy to hear you say hello.
Nature also makes Rahaq happy.
"Yes... and animals too, animals also make Rahaq happy."
"Animals which are fluffy and cute, Rahaq likes things which are fluffy and cute."
"Well, we usually do regular patrols of the area surrounding the city, making sure it's clear of all rubbish and clutter, that any fallen trees are out of the way and won't cause harm to other plants."
"We see to the welfare of the animals in the nearby forest, and tend to any sick or injured creatures we find."
"But, if we're lucky, we'll get a job that takes us to a specific area to deal with a real threat, such as a forest fire, or even trying to suppress an outbreak of a disease."
"The Rangers Guild? The guild has been in Tamriel for hundreds of years! We have outposts in all the provinces, where we do our part to protect the fragile balance of nature."
"If you'd like to learn more about the history of the guild, I suggest visiting Guildmaster Silverneck at the Leyawiin guildhall, she knows pretty much everything there is to know about our history."
"What, are you trying to tell me I'm old?"
"HA! Calm down kid, I'm only kidding! I know I'm not as young as I used to be."
"I've been in the Rangers Guild since I was just a kid, maybe sixteen or seventeen years of age."
"My whole life I've dedicated to this guild and its cause, and I don't regret a single moment of it."
Never mind that.
...
...
This I can answer!
"You are in a lot of trouble, and we can make it all go away!"
"You can claim that, yes. But do you believe that the court will believe you, a commoner, an adventurer, before a countess?"
"And you guess right. Now we have a proposition for you... come, let us sit down."
"Nevermind that. Just be quiet and listen to me, and maybe we can come to some sort of arrangement."
You're not listening: I said shut up!
Oh for the love of the Nine!
Listen to me carefully. You have made contact with some very disturbing people and we need you to keep us informed of their doing.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere!
Listen to me carefully. You have made contact with some very disturbing people and we need you to keep us informed of their doing.
You just don't see it do you?
...your new friends from the Rangers Guild!
"Exactly! What the heck is the Rangers Guild. And if they're rangers like they say, what are they doing in cities? Why do they recruit people with some mumbo-jumbo questions where none relates to the wild?"
Of course we do. We are the Da.... Oh clever one! I didn't see that one coming.
"Anyway, you seem to have risen fairly quickly in their ranks and even met their leader. We need that kind of access for our purpose..."
Isn't it obvious?
We are a branch of the Blades. I suppose you already know about the Swords...
We know you met them in the abbey near Chorrol.
"Like I said, they are the Swords, the close guard of the Emperor. The Blades are composed of three branches and the two others are the Hammers - that always made me laugh - and the Daggers."
The Daggers of course.
"The Hammers are the builders, smiths and instructors among the Blades. They are mostly Daggers and Blades who are retired from active duties and go on teaching others their trade or just brilliant smiths or architects in direct service of the Emperor."
We are the intelligence service for the Emperor.
"Well you can put it that way. Our trade takes place in the dark while the Swords act openly. We ensure the safety of the empire by gathering information, thwarting the plans of other provinces to weaken or destroy the Empire."
"We do have some elimination missions, though we mostly outsource them to the Dark Brotherhood."
"I don't suppose you do, but that's okay. We make sure that the Empire is safe and direct the guilds toward these objectives, all of them but the Rangers Guild, which is why we suspect there is something going on there."
"Yes, I know that the emperor asked the Rangers Guild to look after the Arboretum rabbits, but that was merely a bone thrown at them to see how they would act."
Surprisingly they took the job seriously. More seriously than we could expect. That made them even more suspicious...
It is my job to look for ulterior motives in everyone's actions. And the Rangers Guild never took any of the missions we asked of them. They seem to have their own plans and we want to know what they are.
"Yes, that's where you come in. For some reason, you are going up fast in their organisation. I'm sure they did a background check on you and yet they let you rise among their ranks."
We need you to keep us informed of their plans and every mission they are assigning to you.
For starters you walk free instead of meeting with the Nine sooner than you wanted to. And you can serve the Blades on our mission to protect the Empire.
Isn't that what the Emperor saw in you in that jail?
"It is my job! But nonetheless, we are willing to grant you the same confidence the Emperor granted you. So what do you say?"
"There is not much to think about: either you hang, or you walk free."
Good. Of course we will keep an eye on you in case you decide to betray us. We don't take betrayal very kindly. And we don't always hand over our assassination duties to the Dark Brotherhood if you see what I mean.
Good. Of course we will keep an eye on you in case you decide to betray us. We don't take betrayal very kindly. And we don't always hand over our assassination duties to the Dark Brotherhood if you see what I mean.
You already started. Your first mission was to infiltrate the Rangers Guild. Congratulations! You succeeded. I hereby grant you the title of Rabbit in the Hole!
"Sorry, I always thought that a little humour here and there could lessen the tension in an uneasy situation."
"You'll find your equipment in the chest over there. You are free to go now, just open that door behind you and follow the passage until you're outside."
Those charges are cleared as long as you keep working with us.
Just do your part and we will see that no harm comes to you. Your time in prison will be considered as a mistake and the Rangers Guild will never know what really happened here.
She is probably still waiting for your report. She doesn't know you have been jailed. No one knows... just get your equipment from the chest behind you.
"If you have any problems leaving, speak to the guard in the office above, he has been instructed to ensure you are released without trouble."
"You don't. But we will find you, we'll be watching."
"I don't see how that's any of your business, but I really couldn't care less."
"I grew up in Skyrim, and I lived there until recently... but I wanted a change of scenery, so I packed up all my belongings and took a carriage across the border to Cyrodiil."
"No sooner had we got beyond the sight of the border patrol, we were ambushed by bandits."
"I lost everything I owned... what they didn't steal, they burned."
"So, when I finally reached Bruma, after walking the rest of the way, I didn't have much choice but to come to the Refugee House."
Is that what you wanted to hear? I don't understand why you'd even care.
"Oh, I do get embarrassed when people call me that, I'm just doing what I feel is right... I'm no hero, I'm just sharing what I have with those who are less fortunate than I."
"As you get older, you begin to see life differently! You realize that you can have all the money in the world, but it won't make you happy."
"So, I share what I have with others, so they can feel happy, which in turn makes me feel happy! Do you understand now?"
"I visit the Refugee House on a regular basis, bringing them food and drink, even warm clothes and bed linen..."
"It breaks my heart to see them suffer the way they do, especially when I have such a warm house, and more food than I could ever hope to eat."
"Y-yes it is! Now, now go on, get out!"
S-so? What of it?
N-no! R-really! It's my house! It's always been my house! Now get out!
"O-okay, look! It's not what it looks like! I didn't kill them, I swear! Th-they were like that when I got here! Please, don't call the guards! They'll lock me away for something I didn't do!"
"I was just so sick of the cold, alright! I came in to get warm, and I found them like that! Honest! Please, please don't tell the guards!"
"Even if they don't arrest me, they'll lock this place up, and I'll have to go back out into the cold!"
"Heh heh, it's good to be prepared, ain't it? You never know what tomorrow will bring! A blizzard could block me in for days, then what? Nope, I got everythin' I need right here, I'm completely self-sufficient."
"Well, you see... my wife and I, we're not really poor! We're only pretending to be!"
"Because living rich is just so... boring! Getting down and dirty, you really start to know what kind of person you are!"
"Having all your chores done for you, your meals served for you, everyone waiting hand and foot on you, it's just so... drab!"
"So my wife and I decided to run away from the estate, and start a new life as poor people! We still kept our money, but we make sure it doesn't show."
"We have a nice little house that doesn't have too much of a draft, just enough clothes to keep us warm, and enough food to keep us full."
"Hey, don't tell anyone about this, okay? We've made some really nice friends down here in the slums, and if they knew about our money, I don't think they'd be too friendly to us anymore."
Well... I didn't do too well... at school... and once I grew up... my parents made me... leave home...
I didn't... have anywhere else... to go... so... I came here...
It's not a very nice place... but it's warm... and it has somewhere to sleep... so I don't mind...
"I don't have enough money to buy my own house! This house belonged to my parents, and I've lived here all my life! So, when they passed away, I got the house..."
Maybe I should just sell up and move further south.
"Ohhh, because I love them! Those cute little feet, those sweet little eyes, their big fluffy coats! I love everything about them! Oops, watch your step! Heh heh, maybe I don't love everything about them."
"Of course! Where else would I have gotten a timber wolf, or a black bear?"
"Goodness no! Not if you show them a bit of love and kindness, that is! I hand-feed all of my animals, and I never get bitten."
"What do you mean, what do I do? Isn't it obvious? I take dead people, stick 'em in boxes, and then throw 'em in the ground! It's not that hard to work out, is it?"
"And if their families pay a little extra, I'll even make sure it's a nice box! In the end it doesn't really matter how nice the coffin is, they're all eaten by worms anyway."
"Sure am! Most of the meat in this town is supplied by me, and a lot of the clothes made here are made with my wool!"
"There aren't too many places this far north where sheep can graze happily, so I built them their own little spot inside my house where it's warm and dry."
"Not much to it, really... probably the hardest part is catching the damn animal first! You just cut it, shave it, wash it, dry it, like I said, there isn't much to it."
"But, if you don't know what you're doing, you're just going to make a mess of a perfectly good hide, and that would be a shame."
"Hey, you know what? You look like a bit of a hunter, eh? Listen, I'm not as young as I used to be, and tracking wild animals is starting to get hard on my poor legs."
"If you can bring me five pelts from both bears and wolves, I'll be sure to make it worth your while."
"So, got me those furs I asked you for yet?"
"Eh, no sweat, take your time! I'm not going anywhere anytime soon, and I have plenty of other pelts to keep me busy in the meantime."
"Remember, I'm wanting five bear pelts and five wolf pelts."
"Hey, these are good! You skinned these yourself? You're a pretty good hunter! Here, your payment, as promised!"
I was born this way! I guess the gods decided that it was my fate to have a face such as this.
"While I may not be beautiful, at least I still have the ability to create beauty... I am an artist."
Yes... I painted them all.
You're too kind. It's been a long time since anyone gave me a compliment. Most people tend to be frightened away by my face.
"Men recoil, women scream, and children cry, so when I go out into the town, I make sure to cover my face."
"My paintings are well received, and I almost always sell out, but if I were to ever show my face, I doubt anyone would be interested in my art."
Oh so you've returned at last. I was expecting your report quite some time ago. My guards already informed me of your success.
Now that Anvil is freed from their trouble-making we can tend to other matters.
Have you dealt with them yet?
Ah yes of course. There is a house you can use for your guild. Here is the key and the deed for it.
"The two ships you sunk have been washed out to sea, and I think I shall make use of the third ship for Anvil."
"If this is all, you are free to report to your guild that they are welcome in Anvil."
"The two ships you sunk have been washed out to sea, and I think I shall make use of the third ship for Anvil."
Oh? you mean that ship belongs to the Rangers?
Oh I see. Then your guild will be allowed to recover it of course.
"If this is all, you are free to report to your guild that they are welcome in Anvil, and we'll have their wood shipment delivered to their new guildhouse by the morrow."
So you did it. I knew I could count on you. You are an asset to this guild that is for sure.
"The new head of the Anvil branch, High Ranger Culumani, will be most pleased with our progress."
The wood that was lost to a pirate attack earlier?
Excellent! Perhaps you could inform High Ranger Moorswind when you are next in Skingrad. Now we can have some new superior bows made. Wonderful!
"You did more than we expected, and we have to prepare the new guildhouse for the new recruits and their master. But you need to relax now, and take some time for yourself. Maybe you could take this time to know more about your comrades in the guild."
Perhaps you could find out why Glassclaw has been so distracted lately.
"I'd been informed a prisoner was being released today. Sure is unusual. Once you're on Hangman's Row, that's it, normally, you'll be in your cell until your hanging comes around."
"Apparently you were brought here by mistake, I do hope you didn't find the stay too hard. Well, the key to the gates is here on the table beside me, you go on now so I can get back to my book."
"Didn't I already tell you? The key's right there on the table, now leave me to my book."
"I sure am! Enoch Nuccius. I'd shake your hand but as you can see I'm covered in flour right now. Olive taught me all her recipes, and I mass produce them to meet the public demand."
"The money is pretty decent, but the best part is that I get to live here for free, as long as I keep doing a good job."
"If my memory serves me right, I've been here coming up forty years next month! I've been a baker for almost all my life, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon."
"If it wasn't, don't you think I would have closed the shop by now? The people of this city know quality baked goods when they eat them, and that's why they've been coming back here for years."
"Nah, I'm just a customer that likes to stand behind the bar and serve drinks to other customers! What do you think? Of course I own the tavern! Well, it's a joint effort of both me and my husband Ghamul."
"But don't let the name of the tavern fool you, we're more than just a dive for drunks to drown their sorrows! Our biggest selling point is our fantastic food."
"Sure does, well, it belongs to both me and my wife, that is! She tends to the customers, and I just keep things running smoothly."
"We like to run a good, wholesome family business here, so there's only a two drink maximum, we don't need drunks messing up the place."
"And don't think we're pushovers either, you start making trouble, and I'll throw you out on your arse."
Hey do you have any good meat?
I need to give Scruff his medicine but he won't take it unless it is in deer meat. I think the flavour of that meat covers up the medicine.
Thanks. I'll need three slabs of juicy deer meat. When you can.
"Thank you. If you've got some time, would you speak with Edrik in the Skingrad guild house?"
Do you have some time to help me with something?
Okay. Maybe next time then.
"Vibrations, hearing, all that is fine but I heard magic could help me see again, if not completely, at least a bit."
Another ranger told me about this wandering mage who teaches people some stuff for a price. Not sure that the Mages Guild approve but I really would like to meet him.
"The problem is that being blind, even if I can still shoot a moving target, or know how many people are in a room and which of them are armed and such, I still don't know who is who unless I've met them and heard them before."
I don't know if you do any magic but there is this spell I heard of which lets you see living creatures. I need someone to teach it to me. I already asked around in the Mages Guild of Skingrad but they refused.
"Their leader is always so busy, with what I don't know. She seems to forget things as soon as she thinks of another thing..."

"I know you do, but I don't!"
That was a joke!
I just need you to find that mage for me.
Of course: Ma'Calto the Cursed.
Indeed. But I really want this spell.
I really need your help here. And if you do I'll put a good word for you in Moorswind's ear.
I really need your help here. And if you do I'll put a good word for you in Moorswind's ear.
I last heard he was around Cheydinhal.
As you wish. Maybe next time.
"Oh, you remembered. You have time to help me find Ma'Calto now?"
Thank you for this. Maybe Meadowdark will be interested too if the spell is any good.
Never heard that name before. But it sends shivers straight down my spine.
"Yeah I saw him alright, a shady one. He was heading over to Harlun's Watch if I remember correctly."
Never heard that name before. But it doesn't sound like someone I would like to meet anyway.
Never heard that name before. But it does not sound like someone I wish to meet anyway.
Yes I saw him. Shady character. He was heading to Harlun's Watch.
Oh I do! I see you with my mind. The eyes are deceiving. So I tore them out. And now I can see more clearly than you do.
"(Ma'Calto describes your outfit with uncanny precision, naming the exact nuances of colour to perfection and the exact measurements of your weapons)"
"It's nothing... Thanks to this vision, I'm no longer subject to any illusion, and I mean any. I can see the truth and only the truth. That's my curse."
"Just that my friend. It is a burden no one should bear. I can't be deceived you see. If an Innkeeper tells me he has the best ale around while he knows it is not true, I see it in his word. I see the ugly truth about it. and that's just an example."
"But it is no spell, it is a curse."
Yes I do. I teach little spells to people for a fair price. I see the magic potential in people and also their true nature. I can teach them some harmless spells they can handle.
You have a lot of potential! But I won't teach you anything. You don't need my spells anyway.
I see that now.
Sorry but I can't curse him like I have been.
"Do you think I cursed myself? No my friend. When I was younger I had much potential just like you, and my master told me so. He also told me that due to this potential he would spend twice the time he usually used to teach an apprentice to teach me."
"But I didn't want to wait. All he was teaching me I already knew. I wanted more, I wanted all."
"So I took one of his books, one which I knew he wouldn't want me to read and I learned about that Daedra Prince who only teaches you the truth. I saw no problem with that. It was only the truth right? It can't harm anyone, I thought."
"So I called him. I made a nice circle to protect me and everyone around. I wasn't going to make any mistakes, and the truth is I didn't, except for one."
"The Daedra Prince was in my circle, nothing could go wrong because I had enough expertise for that and then I asked him to let me see the truth. Sounds harmless doesn't it? But nothing ever is with daedras, for he also saw the potential in me."
"He saw my perfect binding circle, he saw the depth of my unachieved mastery. And just like that, he gave me what I wanted."
"He jumped into me! I couldn't stop it. I hadn't thought of that case. I thought he would be bound by my circle and he was, but as soon as I asked him for the truth, which he is the incarnation of, I let him enter me."
"I had made a protection to not let anything come out from me. Not my soul, not my blood, not even my saliva."
"Nothing could get out and when the Daedra entered me, he was trapped inside. And I could see the truth. I could see it all! And I hated it! I went mad..."
I destroyed everything because it was all rotting! The truth is horrible! I killed my master because I didn't recognize him when he came in. All I saw was some zombie corpse heading toward me.
I couldn't hear a thing. All my other senses shut down because I asked to see the truth and that's what I was getting.
"After a week, or a day, I can't tell, maybe a month, of rampaging I found the courage to tear out my eyes so they wouldn't offend me anymore. And then I found peace again. Well, after the terrible pain went away."
And then I heard him. He was still trapped inside me. He wanted out! But my preparation was perfect so he couldn't do anything to harm me in any way. I could even shut him off if I wanted to and I count my blessings there.
"But not for long. The truth can't be escaped. Not having eyes only let me see the surface of things, not the deeper truth inside. But I can still see it. I know what is inside now and this truth I can't escape."
But I also can't let the Daedra escape. This is my curse. So I can't help your friend... sorry.
"Of course you do, but I don't!... I'm kidding, I see too!"
"You can tell your friend that you didn't find me. Or that I wouldn't teach you the spell, or even the truth if you'd like. I would like the truth also..."
Did you find him? Did you bring back Ma'Calto? I don't hear him...
What do you mean? He refused to teach it to you? I know he is blind too and people say he sees clearer than any of them.
Oh. It's not a spell then. That's why he's named the Cursed. I understand.
"Cheer up pal! It's not like I wasn't blind already. I just wanted to see a bit more. But I'm fine! Don't worry about me. I'll tell Moorswind how helpful you were. Oh, I think Rahaq would like to speak to you too."
Rahaq needs help.
Rahaq made a present for Lihandril. Will you deliver it for Rahaq?
Rahaq is shy. Rahaq doesn't know if Lihandril likes Rahaq. Help Rahaq!
Rahaq thanks you.
Really? How nice! Show it to me!
What is this? Is this your idea of a joke? A dead mouse in fluffy pink fur? Are you crazy?
Rahaq you said? Isn't that a Khajiit? A female Khajiit! What does she want?
By the Nine! You're right. I read about this. They offer dead rodents to the people they like as a token of their love... I'll handle this. You stay out of it. Not a word! Go help Emir with something...
"You will never talk about this to anyone, hear me?"
So are you busy right now?
I mean... err... how can I say this?
It's a delicate matter... remember I told you about an outbreak of disease?
I need to send something to this woman I met in Leyawiin while I was visiting there.
I had a disease alright! And I'm pretty sure she has it too now! I can't go to her like that! She will hate me.
"Listen, I need this as a favour. I'm not a bad person. We are in the same guild, right? Help a fellow member will you?"
"Thanks a lot, friend. Her name is Emelia Blonia, and she works for the Topal Trading Company in the Southern Docks."
I'm not feeling so well.
"I'm sick. I don't know why but I have... sorry, I'm just sick."
Are you some sort of miracle cure vendor or something? I know the type. You sure don't look like it but I know them.
Then what is it then? Who are you?
Oh I knew someone from that guild! Thinking of it...
He gave me this disease! The bastard!!!
Calm down? That no-good son of a whore gave me a disease and you want me to calm down?
Oh?... Sorry about that. I guess he did well not to come here himself though. I would have kicked him in the face instead of listening. I guess he didn't know he was sick before...
Well thank you for this cure. Tell him thanks too. Not sure I want to see him any time soon but it is good of him to provide me with the cure and he was not too bad in the... well thank you!
"Oh no, please, don't leave, you've only just arrived! We have food and drink, some of which is just to DIE for... care for an apple?"
"Nope, I'm actually a blonde. I just use the blood of my victims to dye it red."
"You should be! I'm all out of blood, and I think I see a grey hair poking through! And look, a whole sack full of wonderful, warm blood, standing right in front of me!"
"No, don't go! We've barely gotten to know one another! Wouldn't you like to see my collection of sharp objects?!"
"Grab your victim by the head, spin his neck until he's dead! Round and round his neck will go, when it pops, who will know?!"
"Why?! I'm just a happy singing fellow! Ohhhh, pull his fingers 'til they snap, stuff his mouth with linen wrap! Cut off all his little toes, then crush his big fat stinking nose!"
"Just a little muscle I hired to protect my store! Since I carry so many gems and gold items, I'm a perfect target for lowlifes and petty thugs."
"Of course, sometimes I think perhaps he's a little heavy-handed! Just yesterday he reduced a nice old man to tears, because he got too close to the display."
"Nah, I've got a Dunmer girl living here with me... says she doesn't have enough money to rent a room at the inn, so she's working at the store just down the path, and paying me a little to rent my attic out."
"Don't get me wrong, I like the girl, she keeps me company, and she even cleans up after herself."
You can't fool me with your lower class words! Someone please help me!
"Sure is! I opened it along with my wife, Nar-Kagra, a while back now! It seems my wife enjoys riding horses rather than eating them, shame really, I have a killer recipe involving rosemary and garlic."
"What, Miaren? Just some kid looking for work... I felt sorry for her, so I took her on, and I don't regret it! She works hard for someone so young, really earns her gold."
"Yep, my husband and I opened a few months ago! I have a passion for riding, so we pooled our money together and bought the shop."
"Of course, my husband's love for horses is a tad different than mine."
"While I enjoy being on the back of a horse, the only place he enjoys horses is in his big fat stomach."
Oh... that would definitely explain why I've been losing...
"They asked me to visit the guard house to speak with captain Dion, but I haven't gotten around to it yet."
"Yes, well, I'm sure I'll pop over when I have some time."
"Ohh, oh ho ho, ohhh... just some stuff this Argonian sold to me, something called Hist... woooo, hoo hoo..."
"Hey, I don't give a damn what you think! I can do whatever I like, it's my money!"
"Rich life is boring, but I'm not ready to give up my luxuries, not like my parents who ran off to Bruma."
"So, I guess having fun with what I have is my best option... oooh, look at that one, ooooh..."
"Yeah, a person like you! A goody-two-shoes, a do-gooder, an all-out pansy! We don't take kindly to your kind around here."
"My patrons get a bit antsy when one of your kind comes around here, it always seems to lead to trouble, like the town guard getting their nose into our business."
"So perhaps it's best you just turn around, and walk right back out that door, and never come in here again, that is, if you know what's good for you."
"Sure do, your little activities have caused quite a stir among my customers! Seems you've been up to a little mischief."
"Well, I say a little, but you've been doing things that would even make the Gray Fox blush."
"I inherited the Spa from my late lamented husband, he was something of a barbarian, but a fastidiously clean one."
"We designed and built the Spa together, there are hot springs which flow beneath Bruma just below the caverns."
We enlarged this cave and used wards to bind the ice so that it wouldn't melt. The spring water is drawn up through the rock via natural vents.
"We control the temperature by adding icemelt water, it costs almost nothing to maintain, so I let everybody in Bruma use it free of charge."
"We do charge for our other services though. If you would like something to drink see Luciana, my serving girl."
"And I can personally recommend Hald's massages, the man's fingers are blessed by Mara, Dibella, Kynareth - I swear!"
"It's 25 gold an hour, and by the looks of you it will take at least two hours to get the knots and kinks out."
"So, 50 gold."
"Good. Lie down on the bed at the far end, get comfortable, and I'll be with you shortly."
"I promise you, it'll be worth it. Come back if you change your mind."
Yes... Yes!
I'm fine!
Wrong?
"Olaf loves it here! He's here constantly, standing in the corner, almost as if he were frozen."
"Now if you'll excuse me, I really am a very busy woman..."
Your eyes... you have the same look in your eyes that my husband used to have before he disappeared...
"Yes, it's been a while since he left... he went on a trip to Kvatch, and then I never saw him again."
"He always had a head for adventure, so I'm not surprised he's gone."
"I'm sure he's fine, I doubt anything bad has happened to him... he's just off searching the world, just like he's always wanted to."
"Yes, he's a deckhand on a cargo ship heading to the Summerset Isles, he left a few weeks ago, and he won't be back for some time."
"Since then, there's been nothing to do, so I've just been wandering around the house in a haze."
"Recently I've taken up the task of repairing all of my husband's old clothes... it's boring, but at least it's not as boring as doing nothing."
What do you mean? It's brilliant! It's about time women stood up for themselves and showed those pigs we call men that we're not the inferior gender!
What? You did?
"Ah, you're a fool! You don't understand what you've done! You have no idea how it feels to be a lower class woman in this day and age!"
"Why shouldn't I be? I have a big, warm, wonderful house, plenty of food and drink, clothes, and the best husband a woman could ask for."
"Some people may turn their nose up at a Bosmer in wedlock with a human, but I don't care! I love Torlinda with all my heart, and he loves me with all of his, and that's all that matters!"
"I collect expensive bottles of wine, and sell them at very reasonable prices, to sophisticated individuals such as yourself, someone who can truly appreciate the beauty of a fine wine."
"If you're willing to take the time, I'd be more than happy to show you what I have, if you're interested."
"Rough is a bit of an understatement! If it isn't sailors just coming off a long stint at sea, it's pirates coming to raid our wine cellars and befriend our women!"
"But, you give 'em a good hard drink, and they'll mellow out... that is, unless you give 'em too much to drink, then the fights start."
"You kidding?! Everyone around here likes a good brawl! Heck, I'd be more worried if they stopped fighting!"
"Not going to cause any trouble, are we?"
You wouldn't want to start any trouble.
Because then I'd have to get angry.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
"No, we haven't, but you seem like a nice person! My wife and I try to think the best of people, and, well, it's served us well thus far."
What? So you're not here for...
"If you're not a buyer, then get out of my face! Go on, get lost and go bother someone else! Some people..."
"I design and concoct most of the potions that are used here at the University by the students and the scholars, and almost all of the potions that are sold to the merchants in the city."
"The quality of the potions comes not only from my many years of experience, but also from the wide variety of fresh alchemical ingredients which are grown here at the University."
Hmm yes... I was just thinking of the past. When I was... you know... a pickpocket.
"No, I know that, but there're still some things I did which bother me."
"After being released from prison and joining the Rangers Guild, I recovered some loot in a cache I had... I'm not proud of it but I was still thinking that I wouldn't last long here. A lizard has to be prepared."
"I never sold the loot, but there is something in there that needs to be returned to its owner."
Maybe you can help me?
Yes please.
"Listen, I just recently grew a conscience, I don't really know how this kind of thing works."
So you just give it to them tell them you found it lying around and thought it might be theirs.
"They never knew I took it and I don't want them to know it was ever stolen. For all they know, it was just misplaced and lost. I couldn't look in their eyes and lie to them."
"So you just give it to them, tell them you found it lying around and thought it might be theirs."
"Telling them the truth will only hurt them while giving them this little white lie will make them happy, so which do you prefer?"
"Telling them the truth will only hurt them while giving them this little white lie will make them happy, so which do you prefer?"
"Do as you please, but just give them this ring."
"Do as you please, but just give them this ring."
A couple named Hanse who live in Leyawiin. It's their wedding ring. Pure gold...
I already have a wife you know?
Really? Let me have a look. I'll be damned! It is Yvette's ring. Where did you find it? Oh by the Nine she will be so happy! This is incredible news! I can't wait to give it back to her. Maybe I'll re-enact our wedding just for the occasion.
Don't tell her you found it will you?
"Leave me now, I have preparations to make. Consider yourself invited of course!"
A ring? I lost mine a long time ago...
Let me have a look. Oh my... it is my ring! Oh my...
"What? You found it? Oh by the Nine this is incredible! She fainted, the poor thing. I understand now. This is so wonderful! You wouldn't believe the sorrow she was in when she lost it."
"I think I will propose to her again when she wakes up! We will re-enact our wedding. It will be wonderful! Just like the first time I married her. And you're invited of course! Please leave us now, so I can help Yvette."
You gave it back?
Good. Did you tell them the truth?
What do you mean? They kicked you out of their house?
Explain please.
What? You mean they were so happy to get the ring back that they decided to re-marry to celebrate?
Oh my... I never thought it would make them so happy... I would have returned it sooner if I did. But I was so scared they would be mad and get me thrown in jail again.
"Thank you my friend. By the way, Jordi would like to have a word with you when you have some time."
Don't you hate urbanisation? Seeing all natural resources plundered by unsavory people who only care about filling their pockets with more gold.
"Listen! I just received some information about a group of people mounting an expedition, to claim some new land because of new resources found there. The greedy bastards will ravage mother nature for some rocks."
I need someone to assist me in this.
"I'm going to follow them and see what they want exactly. If they are as bad as I think they are, they are going to be very sorry!"
"Well that's up to them. If they can't understand that nature needs to be protected and that we only take what we need to survive and nothing more to preserve the balance, I will do what I must do."
I'm not going to assassinate them! I will try to convince them they are doing bad things first. If they won't understand... Silverneck agrees with me and she is already going to talk to the authorities of Leyawiin about this issue.
"We have been granted authority by the emperor to protect nature and preserve balance. If we can get proof of their wrongdoings, then we are authorised to take any action necessary to stop them."
Not exactly. They are only the hired goons. We need to know who is hiring them.
There is someone who handles information of all sorts. If he doesn't know who's hiring then he will know someone who knows.
Arthos Dumaine from the Topal Trading Company. Little goes by that he doesn't know about. It is a business necessity for him.
"Good luck to you. I'll be gone so if you discover anything just send me the information through the Gold Horse Courier, they know where to find me."
"Of course you do. I knew you didn't visit me just for the pleasure of my company, right?"
"Go on then, tell me what you need."
Who sent you?
"Oh, I see. I guess he wants to know who hired the members of the prospector expedition who left the city yesterday."
I don't know who hired them. All I know is that their orders came through a middle-man in Anvil. So you might check there.
"Sure, it's a good client of ours... but of course you understand that I can't go giving away this kind of information to just anyone who comes here asking."
"Maybe you can come back later and for the right incentive, I'll have the information you need."
"500 septims! Just the right price, friend! His name is Sea Scale. He owns the Shipwright in Anvil Bay. Tell him I say hello will you?"
The name of the middle-man in Anvil who hired the prospectors?
Oh that's an unusual request. It is not a merchandise I sell. What kind of information would you need?
"Oh yes. A passing lord asked me to find some people to prospect a mine around Leyawiin. He gave me a map of the location, and asked me to get some people knowledgeable in mining, as well as some muscle to protect them."
He paid in advance. I'm a business-Argonian. Why do you ask?
Oh you're from the Rangers Guild. I heard they just moved into Anvil. They got rid of those pesky pirates too! That was very kind of them.
The pirates were attacking ships from here to Leyawiin when they were at sea. It was a huge annoyance for my business.
"Yes indeed. So I owe them, and if you are part of the Rangers Guild I am happy to help any way I can. The name of that lord is Velarios Mello. He comes from High Rock. He was staying at the tavern in town while I arranged the expedition for him."
I'm afraid he is gone. He took a ship two or three days ago to return to his home. I guess he will be back sometime soon to check on the progress of the expedition.
"Yes of course, I will inform the Rangers Guild as soon as he sets foot in Anvil again."
"No problem, now is there anything else I can help you with?"
Of course. We are here to serve. May I ask what is it you want to deliver exactly? Letter or package?
"Certainly. If you will just fill in this form with your name, and the address of the person you want to deliver the letter to, we will be happy to have it delivered as soon as possible."
"Thank you, the price will be ten septims please. We of course guarantee delivery."
Have a good day.
"I'm sorry but unless you can pay, we cannot provide our services."
"Our hotel not only is surrounded by nature's beauty, but it is integrated with it also!"
"Downstairs, we have a hot spring bathing area, where you can relax to the sound of clear, running water while you simply cleanse your worries away!"
"And upstairs, we have our own internal nature reserve, teeming with tame wildlife and beautiful, lush surroundings!"
"I tend to the wildlife here in the Arboretum! I keep checks on all the plants and trees as well, and make sure everything is running smoothly."
"I sometimes do the weeding of the gardens myself, and pruning of dead or overgrowing branches on trees, but my daily concern is combating any diseases that threaten the animals or the plants of the Arboretum."
"Oh darn it, I can't even convince a stranger! I'm not fantastic, I just get people to call me that to make me feel better."
"The fantastic one in my family was Tamika, I'm sure you've heard of her and her famous wine! Her wine is found all over Cyrodiil, and what do I have? Nothing."
"You'd think with us being twin sisters, she'd let me work for her so I could make a little money, but she won't even tell me the time of day anymore, not since she started making so much gold."
"That's my name on the sign, isn't it? Heh, sorry, yeah, it's my bakery."
"I'm a little too old now to run it by myself though, so I've had to get two new bakers on to help with the work."
"And I couldn't have picked a better two! Nana and Pellinar work so very hard, and they're worth every septim they earn."
"Sure am! Montfort hired me and Pellinar to help out with the baking, which is understandable, seeing as the guy is so old it's amazing he can still work."
"Before we got here, the shop was much smaller, and he was doing all the baking himself! I still don't know how he did it."
"We have to work hard to meet the demand, but I try to take a much more relaxed approach to the workload, unlike Pell over there."
"Man, that boy is going to drop dead before he starts growing facial hair! He worries so much about how many orders we need to fill, he starts making mistakes and knocking things over."
"Sometimes it's funny to watch, but other times... it just seems rather tragic."
"Are you kidding? I was kidnapped once, taken right off the street in broad daylight, and you know what he did? Nothing!"
"The bandits that took me demanded a handsome sum, and he simply wouldn't pay! He left me at the mercy of those thugs!"
"Luckily when they realised they weren't going to get a slim septim from his bony behind, they eventually let me go."
I still don't know why I stay with that worthless excuse of a man...
"...the food and clothes are nice, though."
I am! I raised most of the plants you see here from seedlings I got from the Arboretum.
"It's still not as pretty as the Arboretum District, but I sure am trying my hardest to get it that way."
"You're darn right it is! I'm the fastest cobbler in Cyrodiil! No, Tamriel! All the others are put to shame!"
"I'm also the only one skilled enough to be able to create two unique sets of slippers, one gold, the other made of a fine, delicate glass."
"They make wonderful gifts, they're fantastic with any formal attire, and go down incredibly well at parties and other high-end functions."
I certainly do! Only way to ensure that the fish are the freshest possible! Almost every fish you buy from here will be within hours of having been caught!
"And since they've all come from the lake around the Imperial City, they haven't had to be salted to preserve them, like you would if you had ordered them from Leyawiin or Anvil!"
"I am the only supplier of Elsweyrian Glass urns and dishware in all of Cyrodiil, each piece shipped in special order from the desert sands of my homeland."
"I also have a large range of gold plates, cups and urns, a pleasant change from the traditional Imperial silver that is common in these parts."
"I am also the only supplier of the Emperor's Finest Soap, rumoured to be the only soap the Emperors of history have ever deemed acceptable to use on their imperial skin."
"But, I also stock simpler items, such as kitchenware, like pots, pans, and kitchen utensils."
"You bet it is! I ship paper, books, scrolls, canvas, and all sorts of other supplies, including quills and inkwells, paint and brushes, and other office supplies, all over Cyrodiil."
"You'll find my personal products in almost every home and store in every city from Anvil, all the way up to Bruma, even as far south as Leyawiin."
"I also ship to the other provinces, but not as much, seeing as they themselves are already quite self-sufficient with stationery."
"You're a sharp one, aren't you? Yes, we sell everything from simple wooden building blocks for the younger customer, right up to paints for the creative child, or a nice teddy to cuddle at night that come in a wide variety of shapes and colours."
"Well, we've only recently set up shop here in the Imperial City, probably two or three months ago, but our business originated from back in Hammerfell!"
"Business was going so well, we decided to expand our little empire into Cyrodiil, and it's a move I haven't regretted once! There are plenty of horse lovers here in the city, and supply is always in demand!"
"Why, me, of course! I've been designing dresses and outfits since I was a teenager, and I know all of the ins and outs of crafting the perfect outfit!"
"Not only is the best skill necessary, but only the finest threads and silks are put into my creations! I simply will not allow second best, and that is what makes me the finest seamstress in the Imperial City!"
That filthy harlot wouldn't know a cross-stitch even if I sewed her great big mouth shut with it!
"Her 'skill' is a mockery to those of my profession! I am in a completely different league compared to her, and don't let her say otherwise!"
"Darn it! I've looked everywhere, and I just can't find a single sample! Perhaps I'll have to head to another town."
"Oh, thank you so much! I've been searching for a few days, but the city is just so big! So much bigger than my hometown of Daggerfall in High Rock!"
What on earth are you talking about?!
"Impossible! I washed my mouth three times this morning, and I...oh, wait..."
"Darn it! You breathe a word of this to anyone, and you're dead, you hear me? Dead!"
I was part of a crew of pirates that tried to attack the Imperial City from the water! Those idiots never even got close to the walls before the Imperial Legion cleared them all out!
"Whoever wasn't killed, was thrown in jail! I was lucky enough to have escaped with my hide intact."
"I'll be sure to pick a better crew next time, so I'm not surrounded with complete and utter morons."
"Heh heh heh, don't let the grey hair fool you, I'm still a highly capable warrior! I've been a member of the Order of the Virtuous Blood for over forty years! Seridur founded the Order and I was one of the first to join."
"I've killed hundreds of vampires in my time, and I know I still have enough spark left in my old bones to kill a few hundred more!"
"Ahh, it's alright! I've been looking for a job ever since I left home a few weeks ago, but I haven't been able to find one just yet."
"Maybe if I keep hanging out at the Market District, someone will offer me a job. Heck, I'd be happy with sweeping floors, as long as it paid well."
"Heh heh, I remember Uriel Septim when he was just a boy! That's how old! But it's alright, I've led a full life, gone on many adventures, so, when the time comes for me to go, I'll be ready..."
"In the end, death is but a new adventure we must all experience."
"Oh... well, nevermind! Hey, how about a friendly game of cards?"
"Don't worry, nothing serious! Just a few little games, a septim or two, here and there! Then, after a few drinks, perhaps we could get a little more serious, hmmm? Care to try your luck?"
You don't trust me? I'm hurt! What could be more trustworthy than a young chap offering to play a game of harmless cards?
"Here, how's this? I'll let you shuffle the deck first, hmmm? Does that make you feel better?"
"Bah, I'm wasting my time with you! There are too many people out there wanting to make a quick septim to spend anymore time talking with the likes of you!"
"You poor bastard! It was brilliant! It looked like Varen was going to finish her, but then the girl turned around and cut his bloody head off!"
"I was on patrol on the outer edges of the city, and when I went to check the opening of a sewer, a damn rat bit me!"
"Ever since then, my leg has turned red and swollen where it bit me, and no potion or healer can fix it!"
"So, until it heals itself, the commander ordered me to bed rest, without pay! And it's driving me mad!"
"Get down! Get down! Or else you'll scare them away! I've been following them for weeks, and I know they're in here somewhere! I just have to find them!"
"Never better! I'm at my absolute prime! And tonight, yes, tonight is the night I find them, and reveal their secret to the world!"
"Yes! Yes, you see, the pixies, they want you to think they're pixies! But little do they know, that I know, that they are, in fact, the infamous Gray Fox!"
Exactly! The infamous Gray Fox is nothing but a horde of impish pixies! It all makes sense!
"Not now! Maybe later! For now, the hunt is on!"
"Hunting, mostly! Yeah, I'm pretty good with a bow, and a sword as well! And I never say no to a good sturdy warhammer!"
"I thought I'd try out for that Rangers Guild they've got going in most of the cities, but they turned me down!"
"They said something about being too brutal with my killings! I don't know what they're talking about! Just because I snapped the creature's neck with my bare hands doesn't mean I'm brutal, it means I'm thorough!"
"Well, I usually spend my mornings talking with my friends, Boderi Farano and Borissean, at the Arcane University."
"I'm a member of the Mages Guild like them, but I think I'm just a little too old to bother with advancing in rank."
"Then, the rest of the day I just wander the city, hoping something exciting might happen... it rarely does, though."
"Indeed I am child, I preach the ways of the Nine Divines, spreading the knowledge to those in need of faith."
"Of late, we have entered dark times. I fear they will not end anytime soon, and the people are in short supply of hope."
"I do what I can to maintain the peace, but, in the end, all of our fates are in the hands of the gods."
"Why else do people walk at night? To see the stars, to enjoy the silence, to embrace the shadow!"
"That, and it is much easier to hide from the town guards at night, while you are trying to break into someone's house! But that is between you and K'Mar, hmmm?"
"That's correct, I have been for at least a decade now! I owe every fine, sunny day to her, so it is a small price to pay, being a dutiful knight to her ladyship."
"No, a fellow priest from the temple I come from, Alanus Medici, has come on the pilgrimage with me."
"We were lucky enough to get accommodations inside the city walls, and even better luck that we were able to make it into the same set of apartments."
"To the Imperial City? No, a fellow priest has come with me! Her name is Clair, and I'm sure she's around here somewhere."
"A shame, but perfectly alright! What can I get for you today?"
"Well, it depends on what you've come to buy! On one hand, you could simply be here to sample my wide range of rare and expensive literature!"
"But, on the other hand, perhaps you are here for the business of a much more... delicate matter? If you wish, I can take you to the goods themselves, and you can meet face to face."
"What, are you an idiot or something?! Keep your damn voice down! You want the entire Imperial Legion breathing down our necks?!"
"Of course it's illegal! If you're not here to buy anything, then leave me alone and don't tell anyone!"
"Ohh, so you're one of those people, hmmm? Well, I can't have you telling the Legion about my little operation, can I? SLAVE! Waste this pathetic worm!"
"I am, and with the way things are at the moment, it's making me quite a bit of coin."
"Just between you and me, I supply certain members of the guild with highly illicit items, most of which have been banned by the Archmage."
"The old man may not think highly of the dark arts, but a few of his students still practice it under his wrinkled old nose."
"Getting the items into the city is a bit tricky, what with the customs officers patrolling all of the gates, but we've got a little system that works just fine."
"Hey, don't judge me! With me here or not, there is still a demand for these items! I just happen to be the one that meets that demand, and makes a fair profit as well."
"Heh, what'd I tell you? You won't find this selection anywhere else, especially not up in the city."
"Who cares where I got them?! It's none of your damn business where, or how I got them! You want them, or not?!"
"Good! Because that's us! Honest to the very bone! We've got plenty of fine wares for sale, as long as you're not interested in asking where it comes from! Heh heh heh."
"Just looking around, my arse! You better not be one of the town guards, or else I'll have Jurno down here in a second to run you through! And if he isn't around, I'll just kill you myself!"
"Well, come on! If we're going to do business, get to it already!"
"Pfft, whatever! Do whatever you want! Just don't go getting friendly with the Rhincodon Gang, or else you'll be killed by us, just like the rest of them will!"
"Those damn slackers were meant to be keeping outsiders away from here! Probably off drinking somewhere! Well, what do you want? You want to join my gang or something? Too bad, there aren't any more positions left! Now beat it!"
"Good! Now, you haven't seen any of those Rhincodon Gang members around here, have you?"
"Well, if you do see them, beat 'em up for us, will you? Saves us the trouble of getting our hands dirty."
Thanks very much!
Well you're no fun.
"Well, you're a pretty lucky kid then! I won't kill you today, but don't think I won't have you executed if you get in the way of the Rhincodon Gang!"
"We stupidly thought we could take on the Aviogetto Gang by ourselves, so we went after their boss, just the two of us!"
"But they had two goons waiting for us, and we were lucky to get away with our limbs intact!"
"But now we're stuck down here in this stupid cave, waiting for the boss to realise we're missing and come rescue us."
They're two gangs battling it out for ownership of the tunnel between the Waterfront and Temple Districts!
"I offer services to the Rhincodons, and offer them decent prices on all of my goods! But I refuse to serve anyone in the Aviogetto Gang!"
"But, as long as you're not an Aviogetto, I suppose I could show you what I have for sale."
"Most people just like to go straight from the Waterfront to the Temple without stopping, and understandably so! If you're not robbed at knifepoint by one of the warring gangs, you're set upon by needy beggars."
"Nobody wants that, especially not the higher class, so they just breeze through quickly, and don't bother to stop and visit our stores."
"So, times are a bit tough, and the money is stretched a bit more thin than I'd like, but we get by."
"Aayisha. We live together, we're just not married yet! I hope we'll get around to marriage one day, but there's no rush."
"The other day, I was down by the Waterfront, right? I was strolling along the beach, and then a mermaid appeared!"
"Yes, a mermaid! She was beautiful too! She told me about a lovely pearl at the bottom of Lake Rumare, and that I should come with her to find it!"
"And then, when we got down there, we found this massive clam! But it was guarded by this huge dreugh! When it saw me, it started throwing spells at me, one after another!"
"But then suddenly, the mermaid turned into the Divine Kynareth! Once she was transformed, she - hey, where are you going? I haven't finished my story..."
"Is good for you! Very tasty! Put hair on chest! Rat meat good, not bad! No disease, clean rats, clean meat!"
"No? Then try Sausage On Stick! Twice as tasty as Rat On Stick, but with less hair! You buy, you eat, you love!"
Is surprise! That is half the fun!
"I did! Baked them all up in my little oven over there! She's small, but she does the job alright!"
"I mean, I can't meet the demands that the bigger bakeries up in the city deal with, but I provide our little city-below-the-city with all the baked goods it needs."
"Rise, rise up my child! For today, you have been saved! Saved from the terrible fate of all those who shun themselves from the light of the righteousness!"
"The Nine Divines smile upon those who would walk the path of justice, and good! And today, you have just taken your first step down this path, this holy path of blinding light!"
"Leave! Leave if you must, but if you leave, you are not leaving only myself, but your destiny, your fate, even the Nine Divines themselves!"
"If you leave this day, you leave behind this chance for redemption! The path you take now is the path that will lead to your place of resting for eternity! Only Oblivion awaits for you!"
"Not that it's any of your concern, I am currently on a trip to the Arcane University on business."
"I come from the Mages Guild in Balmora, a city on the island province of Vvardenfell, in Morrowind."
"Every few years we send a representative of the guild to the Arcane University to discuss matters of the development of magical techniques, whether to learn new ones, or discuss processes we have developed ourselves."
"When we make the trip, we tend to bring an apprentice with us, so they may benefit from the discussions of shared techniques, that they may better themselves in their studies."
"My apprentice, Orvil, should be around somewhere, but try not to bother him! He is currently taking care of my business, and I do not wish for him to become distracted from his objective."
"I most certainly do! I have the tea leaves shipped in from the Summerset Isles, and I brew it here, right in the cafe, using fresh spring water."
"Now, if you'd like, you can drink your tea plain, or you can have it with some fresh sheep's milk, or some light cream I whipped up just this morning."
That's right! I manage and screen all cargo coming in and going out of the city! You'd be amazed at the sorts of things people try and sneak past my officers.
"Some days, you get the usual illicit items, such as illegal narcotics like skooma and aquavit, but other days, you wouldn't believe what comes through here."
I remember once a whole Dwemer Centurion was shipped in from Skyrim in a crate marked kitchen utensils! It took five of my men to keep the damn thing from destroying the Waterfront.
"I also monitor who has booked passage on a ship out of the Imperial City. If you need to travel by ship, you come to me."
"I make sure the vendors around here pay their dues on time! And if they don't, I mess their stands up a little, as an example to not only them, but any other merchant who doesn't toe the line."
"And, if for any reason they continue to come up short, I may get orders to rough up more than just their display."
"Oh, thank you, thank you so very much! I will finally be able to eat real food tonight!"
"Oh... N'dreia understands. It is okay, he will live... for a few more days, at least."
You try smelling like roses without having a bath for a month!
"Now, do you want a good time, or not? I only have-HACK! HACK COUGH! WHEEZE!"
Hold on! HACK! COUGH COUGH! Ugh! <spit>
"Ugh... ugh... anyway, where were we? Hey, where are you going?!"
"Oh, I've been in this business long enough to be able to tell a thief from among a crowd!"
"So, got something hot that you need fenced quickly? I can make any object simply disappear, and at a good rate too."
"I jussst happen to have in my pooosession... a selection of fine wines, ales and gen-<hick>-eral hooch fer the interested customer..."
I take GREAT offense to that un-floun-dered accuuuusation! I am as sober now as I was when I was BORN!
"A little sip, here and there, ne'er killed anyone!"
"So? Do you want to peruuuuuse my goods, or not?"
"THE GIANT CATS! GIANT KITTENS, TO BE EXACT! CAN'T YOU HEAR THEM?!"
"CATS?! WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT CATS! I'M TALKING ABOUT PUDDING! DELICIOUS, MOIST PUDDING! DRIPPING FROM OUR EARS!"
"MAD?! NO, NOT MAD! MAD TASTES HORRIBLE, LIKE WOOD COVERED IN HONEY! SWEET, BUT TOUGH, OH SO VERY TOUGH!"
REGRET! NOW THAT'S A TASTY DISH! SERVED WITH A FEW SHAVINGS OF DOORKNOB!
What are you looking at?!
"You're looking at my hat, aren't you?!"
"You think it's stupid, don't you?!"
You don't think that! You're lying! I know it! Don't lie to me!
"I don't believe you, but I'll let you off this once! Don't let me see you staring at my hat again or I'll turn you into a horker!"
"I do! Along with my husband Sarmane, we run this small magical emporium out here on the Waterfront!"
"We sell alchemical ingredients and apparatus, magical robes and staves, and a wide variety of spells."
"Although, I must apologize for my husband's mood! He's gotten a little grumpy in his old age."
That's right! Why do you look so surprised?
"Young? Bless you child, you've made my day, but I'm not young! I'm eighty-seven years old!"
"A few years ago I came up with a brilliant youth tonic that worked wonders! It took nearly sixty years off my face! The only problem was, I drank the whole bottle, and all my notes were destroyed in a fire!"
"So, I'm sorry to say I can't offer you some, but I must say, you don't exactly look like you need it!"
"Oh, I remember you. You're the one they sent to hire me. I'm doing well, thank you for this opportunity. I feel more like I belong somewhere now, thanks to you and the guild."
Now I remember Culumani mentioned you. He said he wanted to talk to you about something. You better go to him when you have a chance.
I'll be here if you need me.
Very good thank you. And what about you? You seem to be doing fine. I'm happy to see a fellow ranger as always.
I think I heard our guild leader here talk about Culumani from Anvil. I believe he has a task for you.
To thank you for your actions I guess. Though he may also have a task for you. You seem the reliable type and adventurous enough.
Of course. Farewell.
"Right, right! You seem to be able to handle yourself in a fight? Of course you are. you single-handedly dealt with countless pirates and thanks to you the harbor is safe again. I believe you're the right person for the task I have in mind."
I was reading the reports from the other guild houses and it seems that one of our rangers stumbled upon an undiscovered Ayleid ruin in the vicinity of Bruma.
The location of the entrance is very remote and up in the mountains. We have reason to believe that it is not yet known to the local authorities.
We contacted the Archeology Guild about it and they confirmed that they never heard of any Ayleid ruins there. They are very interested in it but do not have the resources actually to make a clean-up of the ruins.
That's why I think we could send someone to check things up there.
"Yes I do. You are as clever as you are strong and resourceful, and making sure those ruins are safe for any deeper archeological crew seems to well within your capabilities, right?"
"Of course! Don't belittle yourself now. You wiped out all the pirates all by yourself. Swam from boat to boat to sink them in the sea and you don't have even a scar on you! Well at least not from this, right?"
"Then you are the hero we need! Here, let me mark on your map where the entrance is exactly."
"Just be careful up there. It seems the ranger who discovered the entrance and reported it went back there later. To this day, we have not heard of him."
We suspect that he is dead so the trip will obviously present some dangers. But he was nothing like you. Or so I heard.
No time for second thoughts. Just be wary and ready to defend yourself if needed. There might be some of those nasty traps the Ayleid liked to lay out in their... what did they call them?
We only know them as ruins because that's what they are now but what were these ruins before they were ruins...
Anyway. Just be careful and come back to us.
"Hmm? Oh, the package, yes. She's the captain of one of the ships docked here, I can't remember which right now. Just go to each ship, you'll find the right one in no time."
"Yeah, well, just keep on walking if you know what's good for you."
"AHARHARHARHAR! Ahh, I never get tired of that! Relax kid, I mean you no ill, I'm only playing with you."
"Sorry about that, but Cyrodiil is boring; it's been a major drag since I got here."
"All these guards around, keeping everyone from having any fun! Back in Skyrim, you could beat the snot out of anyone you wanted and get away with it."
"Yeah, well, if you don't watch yourself, the only sight you're going to be seeing is a knife in your side and your coin purse stolen."
"Mine? Well, yeah, it - wait, no, it isn't! It belongs to... a friend of mine, yeah!"
"His name? Oh, well, it's... Arnie, or... Ernest... erm..."
"Alright look, I don't know the owner, okay? I just found his body down by the water and took his key."
"I haven't stolen anything, not yet at least! I just wanted to stay somewhere until the guards stop looking for me."
"What I did isn't important! And it's not like I killed the guy, he was dead when I found him!"
"Hey, you tell anyone about this, and I will hunt you down!"
"I retired from my business several months ago! For quite a few years I've had a steady flow of work, but now it's become too hard to compete with the smiths in the city."
"Plus, I'm not exactly getting any younger! It was about time I passed the torch to the younger generation, and start enjoying the time I have left in this world."
"Business? Well, I guess it's as good as can be expected for a tavern built next to a graveyard."
"It's a bit slow, and most of the people who come through here don't have much coin to spend, but overall, it's a good living."
We are here under the direction of the Psijic Order to explore the ancient Ayleid Ruins found here in the province of Cyrodiil.
They believe there may be powerful artifacts hidden deep below the earth that may advance our collective knowledge of the ancient race.
"This further knowledge may benefit the lives of many, not only in the region of Summerset, but all of Tamriel."
"Thank you greatly, and good luck to you also in your future endeavours."
"Yes, we are related, but she is my superior first, and my sister second."
I've been trying to perfect some new medicine to help with the victims in the plague house.
"I think something in rotting apples may be just what I need, but I cannot wait for a bunch of apples to go bad!"
"If you could bring me fifteen rotten apples, I would be most grateful."
You don't have fifteen rotten apples with you. I need fifteen!
Oh how wonderful! Thank you so much. Here is a little thank you.
Thank you! I'll be waiting.
Oh.
"Well, I'm sure there won't be TOO many deaths from this plague while I wait for some apples to rot."
Yes you! And why are you dressed like that? You know what you may wear when working for me!
"Oh. Well what are you doing on The Gilded Duckling then? Oh never mind, you must work for the Duke and Duchess."
So you're a thief! Guards!!!
Guards!! Guards!!!
"I see. Well, be off with you then."
Scruffy. I must speak to the Duchess about implementing a dress code for her workers.
"The Duke won't mind if you assist me with something, will he? Of course not."
"Well not any more. Forget about your attire, I need you to do something for me."
"Go and find my husband. But don't let him know, I want you to find out where he keeps going most evenings."
Come back when you know what he's been getting up to.
Excellent. Don't dally.
Don't be stupid. You know the name of your Lord!
"What?! How impertinent! Do as you're told, if you want to keep your job!"
"What?! How impertinent! Do as you're told, if you want to keep your job!"
Excellent. Don't dally.
Get off this ship! You're fired!
Excellent. Don't dally.
How can you be so ignorant? Lord Kildred! Be off with you.
"Nonsense, the Duchess and I are very close, the Duke won't mind."
Fine then! Be off with you. Come back when the Duke has agreed. Which he will!
"Go and find my husband. But don't let him know, I want you to find out where he keeps going most evenings."
Come back when you know what he's been getting up to.
"Lord Kildred and his wife Lady Trivelda are guests of the Duke, and are traveling with us."
"Lord Kildred and his wife Lady Trivelda are guests of the Duke, and are traveling with us."
He's... my husband is.... he's dead?
But how.... when? How?
Leave me to my grief...
"It belongs to Agi. That would be DUKE Agrivaine to you, of course."
"He has a much more luxurious ship, but he lent it to his cousin. Can't think why."
We're visiting the few coastal cities in Cyrodiil.
"Agi has been a close friend of mine since we were children. We grew up together in Shimerene, you see."
Why am I telling you this?
Now why would I want to talk to YOU about my husband? Go talk to HIM!
"Now why would I want to talk to YOU... well, actually..."
I have no idea. We left him behind in Shimerene when we came on this voyage. Agi doesn't like having captains on board.
"Gissy? She's from Alinor I believe. An excellent card player. You should address her as [QUOTE]My Duchess[QUOTE] or [QUOTE]Duchess Giselle[QUOTE], of course."
"I look forward to our card-game tonight, she nearly won the other day!"
"Yes, cards. You know what those are, I presume?"
Certainly not!
"It's on Summerset Isle, where we Altmer live. I have no wish to further discuss this with the likes of you."
Bravil? What's that?
"This is the Gilded Duckling. It belongs to Agrivaine, the Duke. He's a friend of my wife, you know."
"It's not his nicest of ships, being of Imperial design, but it's sturdy enough. I think he said something about his cousin taking his favourite ship."
"Hmm. Yes, well. She's not the easiest of people to get along with. If you get on her bad side she can be most unpleasant!"
"Still, she can be quite a joy to speak with sometimes."
"Agrivaine? Of course, why would you be asking me about any other Duke?"
"A fine fellow, most certainly. So good of him to invite us on this voyage with him."
"We're visiting a few port cities around Cyrodiil, and may go on to some more around Elsweyr on the journey home."
"A most interesting city. It's a little run-down, but I hear that much of Cyrodiil is like that these days. The people are just fascinating you know?"
"Well, yes, but it's still quite glorious! I thought I'd leave the ship for a bit!"
"Yes, Summerset Isle. The Duke and his guests are from the Isle."
"I'm sorry, I cannot talk about the Duke, in case I say something which may put him in danger."
"If you wish to speak to the Duke, he and his guests dine each evening from around 6 o'clock until 9 o'clock."
"I work for Captain Fens, on his ship, The Slough Queen."
"She's a cargo ship. The captain mostly carries exports from Cyrodiil to Black Marsh, but sometimes we visit other provinces."
And back again!!!
"Yes, we visit Soulrest, Lilmoth, and Archon. Never been beyond Archon, though."
"The usual; containers of food, drink, clothing. We have some tasty livestock on-board right now!"
But I'm not allowed to eat them.
"Fens is an Argonian, though he was born here in Cyrodiil. He's been teaching his son Fer the captain-business these past few months."
Perhaps Fens is thinking of retiring some time soon?
What does it matter? Have a drink! And buy me one while you're at it!!
"I really couldn't tell you, my duties don't allow for me to leave this spot unless the Duke orders me to."
Woi?
"Thankee, sir!"
"Thankee, ma'am!"
Crowded. Oi dun' like it.
Oi dun' know no lords!
"Well, I thought I'd try it. You never know, might get lucky one day. How about a single coin instead?"
"Just one, huh? Oh well."
"I knew it was too much to ask. I'd try asking for a copper coin or two, but you'll just say you don't have any. They always do."
I don't want to talk about it.
...
You won't believe me.
You won't.
...
"Oh all right, if it'll stop you staring like that. I was once swallowed whole by a giant slaughterfish. I was stuck in its stomach for two days."
I knew you weren't really interested.
"A pirate crew was fishing for their supper, when the slaughterfish I was stuck in got caught in their nets. They gutted it and I slid out."
They weren't happy to see me.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
"It was in the Abecean Sea. I used to live in Anvil. I had a house there, you know. But someone else moved in while I was missing."
"The pirates forced me to stay on their ship, and made me prepare fish for their suppers every night."
"Eventually they returned to their home. I spent a month in a cell in The Gap, before the crew set sail again."
I'll stop then.
"Well, they were sailing around the Quin'rawl Peninsula one night, and came quite close to the shore."
"So when no one was looking, I jumped overboard and swam for the beach. I found myself in Markgran Brook."
"I stumbled across the Deserts of Anequina, then across the West Weald to Skingrad. From there I followed the road back to Anvil."
"Finally I made it back to Anvil, only to discover that my home was no longer my home."
"So I wandered Cyrodiil for a bit, and finally arrived here."
"It's a pirate haven. On an island somewhere west of the mainland, I believe it was."
"Large cliffs make up the island's coast, but a deep chasm carved into the cliffs is where the pirates have built their homes."
You don't want to end up there!
"A large desert, much as you might imagine a desert to be. There were bands of Ragasha, but I avoided them, thankfully."
"I grew weary of traveling, and since I had no money, and no home, I just stopped moving. Here is where I found myself."
Do I look like someone who would know anyone with a title like that?
"You might think of them as desert goblins, I suppose. They're big rat-men who live in the desert and attack people."
"Leyawiin, you say? That'll be a nice quick trip, only about two hours. It'll cost you 30 gold."
"Oh yes, where to?"
"Ah, the Imperial City! A wonderful place, and not far by ship. You'll have to pay 40 gold for the voyage, and it would take about two hours."
"To Anvil? That will take at least fifteen hours, it would probably be faster to walk! But if you want to sail there, it will cost you 180 gold."
You're a strange one!
Hope you don't get sea-sick. Keep an eye out for pirates too!
"Hang on, that's not enough gold! You'll have to walk!"
You'll really enjoy visiting the Imperial City! Such a busy place.
"Hang on, that's not enough gold! You'll have to walk!"
"Ah, leaving Anvil? Where are you headed?"
What?! You waste my time.
Bravil? Why would you go there? It smells.
"For 180 gold you can take a ship to Bravil, it would take around fifteen hours."
"Ah, Leyawiin! The best place to live, in Cyrodiil. Lots of fresh water to swim in."
"It costs 150 gold to sail there, and it's only about twelve hours by ship."
I suggest you jump overboard before you reach Bravil. Anywhere is better than that dump!
"Maybe pirates will attack the ship, it would be a better fate to die at sea!"
"Hey, you don't have enough money! You are lucky, you've just avoided a trip to the biggest dump in Cyrodiil!"
"Well, I guess some people like big crowded cities. Try not to get lost."
"Hey, you don't have enough money! Go [QUOTE]earn[QUOTE] some more, the Imperial City is expensive!"
I wish I was going with you! I have family in Leyawiin. I hope the weather isn't too stormy along the coast of Elsweyr...
"Hey, you don't have enough money! Why did you waste my time talking about Leyawiin? You can't afford to go there!"
Move along then. Next!
...You don't have enough money.
Get out of my sight!
"Carry on, then legionary."
"Well, where to? Feel free to point on this map if you don't know the name of the place."
"Anvil, huh? Well I can think of worse places. It would take about half a day to get there, and will cost you 150 gold."
"Pigsty. That's where the snotty Altmer went - I'm glad he's no longer here. A ship can get you there in about two hours, for 30 gold."
"The Imperial City, huh? Now that's a destination worth thinking of. I'd live there myself if I could just get promoted."
"It would take about four hours by ship, you'll have to pay 60 gold."
"Dammit, what the hell are you doing here then?"
"Great, now let me get back to work. Tell the captain to avoid the pirates this time!"
"You don't have 150 gold, do you? You idiot, you're wasting my time!"
"Off to the capital you go, then! Visit the Arboretum District, I hear it's most tranquil."
"You don't have 60 gold do you? You idiot, you're wasting my time!"
What?! Why do you want to go to that primitive village? There's nothing there but Khajiit. Nothing else in all of Elsweyr!
"Well, there's a ship headed for Senchal, they can drop you off as they pass. It will take around one hour, and will cost 10 gold."
"You'll regret this, trust me!"
"You don't have 10 gold?! What are you, a beggar? Stop wasting my time!"
"That's a short trip, and the Magnificent is sailing that way soon. Give me 50 gold, you'll be there in about two hours."
"I hear the mines are profitable on Stirk, maybe you'll do some digging?"
"Hey, you don't have enough money! Who doesn't have 50 gold?!"
"Are you joining the army? I have a cousin who tried to join, but they weren't accepting Argonians."
"For 160 gold I can sail you to the Fort, it takes almost seventeen hours."
I heard there are pirates on the coasts of Valenwood these days. Have a safe trip!
"Hey, you don't have enough money! If you want to go to Fort Akatosh, you can march there on the roads!"
"Oh yes, that's just up-river, not far at all. Should only take about one hour, if you want to give me 30 gold."
"Be sure to salute the officers, they expect that!"
"Hang on, that's not enough gold! You'll have to walk!"
"Stirk? I've never been there. Quite a distance, but you can only get there by ship. Well The Magnificent is heading that way shortly."
"Hand me 180 gold, and you'll be there in just over fifteen hours time."
"Hah! You'll never make it as a legionary. Is that why you want to go there? Don't waste your time, you're not soldier material!"
"Well, it's not too far. Only three hours by ship. Hand me 50 gold if you want to go there."
"Still want to go, huh? The pay is lousy!"
"You don't have 50 gold do you? What are you, a beggar? Stop wasting my time!"
"Now Stirk is a place worth visiting! I'd love to live there when I retire. It takes half a day to reach Stirk, and it costs 150 gold."
I just hope the ship doesn't get attacked by pirates before you reach the island!
"You don't have 150 gold do you? You idiot, you're wasting my time!"
That's 40 gold. The trip should take about one hour.
Members of the Imperial Legion can sail from the Imperial City for free.
The trip should take about one hour.
"Don't get in the way of the legionaries there, civilians really shouldn't be visiting the Fort."
Move along then. Next!
...You don't have enough money.
Get out of my sight!
"Carry on, then legionary. Report straight to the fort's commanding officer when you arrive."
That's 200 gold. The trip should take about eighteen hours.
Members of the Imperial Legion can sail from the Imperial City for free.
The trip should take about eighteen hours.
Move along then. Next!
...You don't have enough money.
Get out of my sight!
"Carry on, then legionary."
That's just up the coast! Why go there when you're already here on the coast?
"You can go there for 30 gold, it should only take about an hour."
Not enough water in Sutch for my liking.
"Hey, you don't have enough money! Who doesn't have 30 gold?!"
"Yes, a few ships have started sailing to Sutch again, I hear they already started work rebuilding the city."
"You can be there in almost sixteen hours, if you have 200 gold."
"Weather's looking stormy, hold on tight when you get out to sea!"
"Hang on, that's not enough gold! You'll have to walk!"
"Sutch?! That place is a ruin! Oh, wait, there are ships going there, so there must be something happening."
"Still, you won't find me going there, there wouldn't be any money to make. A ship will get you there in thirteen hours, for 170 gold."
"You still want to go huh? Well, don't say I didn't warn you. No money to be made!"
"You don't have 170 gold do you? You idiot, you're wasting my time!"
That's 210 gold. The trip should take about nineteen hours.
Members of the Imperial Legion can sail from the Imperial City for free.
The trip should take about nineteen hours.
Move along then. Next!
...You don't have enough money.
Get out of my sight!
"Carry on, then legionary."
I gutted them this morning! Fresh-gutted fish!
Who knows? What does it matter? Get your fresh fish!
What are you trying to say?! This is Kashmir's Fresh Fish! I sell fresh fish! These fish are fresh!
So are you going to buy some fresh fish?
"Of course they stink! They're FISH! Fish stink, even fresh fish stink!"
"What are you, a fish expert or something? That's the smell of a freshly-gutted fish! These fish are fresh fish, I just gutted them this morning!"
"Get out! Go on, get out of my store right now!"
FRESH FISH! Get your fresh fish! No adventurers allowed! Get your fresh fish!
Aren't they? You get used to it when working with them.
I just wish I could get rid of the smell when I'm NOT working with them.
"No. The only soap that actually seems to get rid of the fishy smell is called [QUOTE]Emperor's Finest[QUOTE], but it's only available in the Imperial City."
I can't afford to keep paying the transport costs to have it delivered here.
"Well, thanks to you, yes!"
It was so kind of you to go all that way just for me! Now I can feel comfortable about myself when I'm out and about.
"Really? That would be so kind of you! I can pay you of course. Perhaps, four soap bars?"
I look forward to your next visit.
"You do? How marvelous! Please pass it over, here's some gold in payment."
"Hmm, you want to visit the land of the Altmer? A most unusual place, they have funny building ideas!"
"There's an Elf-ship heading that way very soon. For 50 gold you can go with them. Their ships are fast, you should arrive in about four hours."
"Hurry then, the Elves don't waste time!"
"Hey, you don't have enough money! Why didn't you check before agreeing?"
"Traveling to Summerset Isles? How fascinating! Well, that will be quite an adventure for you."
"It will take a ship about fifteen hours to get there, if you want to give me 170 gold for the fare."
Just imagine the sights you'll see. The place is supposed to be magical!
"Hang on, that's not enough gold! You'll have to swim!"
"Summerset Isles? We have some warships heading that way, you could travel on one, as long as you stay out of everyone's way on board."
That's 190 gold. The trip should take about eighteen hours.
Members of the Imperial Legion can sail from the Imperial City for free. The trip should take about eighteen hours.
"We seem to be sending a lot of soldiers to Summerset Isles these days, there's a warship leaving for there shortly."
Move along then. Next!
...You don't have enough money.
Get out of my sight!
"Carry on, then legionary."
"Oh no, you don't want to go to Summerset! Those Elves are crazy! They're all corrupt mages and warlocks or something. You're serious, huh?"
"Fine, it's your life to risk. There's an Imperial warship heading there from the Imperial City, it will take around twelve hours, and cost 140 gold."
Fool.
"You don't have 140 gold, do you? You idiot, you're wasting my time!"
"Senchal is far too hot and dry, not suitable for Argonians. I do have a cousin living there, but he's crazy."
"Close to Argonia though, so it's not all bad. It costs 140 gold to sail there, it should only take about ten hours."
"Watch out for my cousin, stay clear if you see him! Oh and there's pirates and thieves too, but my cousin is the one to fear."
"Hey, you don't have enough money! You're not sailing to Elsweyr!"
"Are you sure you want to travel to Senchal? You must've heard what people say about Bravil, but here is nothing compared to Senchal!"
"The port is filled with pirates, and the city itself has thieves and brigands on every street corner, and cut-purses down every alley!"
"Well, it will take around five hours, if you want to give me 40 gold."
You're either brave or foolish.
Or both.
"Hang on, that's not enough gold!"
"The gods smile on you! You'll be safer here, trust me!"
Elsweyr? That's 60 gold. The trip should take about seven hours.
Members of the Imperial Legion can sail from the Imperial City for free. The trip should take about seven hours.
"It is unusual these days for legionaries to head to Elsweyr, we have more pressing issues than piracy."
Move along then. Next!
"Carry on, then legionary."
...You don't have enough money.
Get out of my sight!
"Not a very safe place, if you ask me. And since you asked, I'll tell you that you wouldn't catch me heading into Senchal's harbour."
"There's always pirates in or near the harbour, waiting for an easy target!"
"Well, it's your life to risk. It would take about two hours by ship, you'll have to pay 20 gold."
"You'll regret this, trust me!"
"You don't have 20 gold?! What are you, a beggar? Stop wasting my time!"
"Here you are, 1600 gold coins!"
"Here you are, 1400 gold coins!"
"Yes, I am he - Cherilp Goldhorn- in the flesh! Owner and operator of the Gold Horse Couriers!"
Mr. Goldhorn was the previous owner and operator of Gold Horse Courier service.
Mr. Goldhorn is the owner and operator of Gold Horse Courier Service. He hired me personally. You can find him at the Imperial City Waterfront.
"Hmm.. you want to be a courier, do you?"
I could definitely use another courier.
"Well, then. Take this handbook on the rules and regulations. You are to read it carefully, and look to it for any questions you may have."
"I don't know how dependable you are, so I'm going to start you off small. Go to the board here or in the other cities and do some local deliveries."
"You do enough of them, and I'll let you start doing inter-city work. Good luck and don't disappoint me!"
You are to follow these rules at all times while you work for me.
"So, you want to be a courier? Well, you need to talk to Cherilp at the Waterfront in the Imperial City."
I need you to drop off a package in a crate at Fort Empire. Now off with you!
The next package needs to be dropped off at Fort Irony. Just put it in the crate like the last one.
I want you to drop this package off in a crate located in the Ayleid ruin of Nornal. And be quick about it!
"This package needs to be dropped off at Ninendava, another Ayleid ruin. Same procedure as before."
"Good work on those crates. Here, a little something for your effort."
"Now, I need you to deliver this package to a man outside Fire and Steel in Chorrol. Now go."
Great! The next package is to be delivered to an Argonian in Leyawiin. You'll find him in the Mermaid Inn.
Good job! You've completed all six deliveries!
"Lavasir, why did you do it? I thought we had an understanding. I paid you well."
"I did it because I found out what you were shipping! And then last week, I heard you sent the new courier on a 'special' mission."
"I don't even care! I gave you a chance, and you threw it away. You're gonna pay for what you've done."
"I knew it was only inevitable before you set me up - just like you set up Borjul. I watched you kill him, and I did nothing!"
"This time, I'm not going to let it happen. I informed the guards about everything. They will hang you!"
"The guards will find me! I was supposed to meet with them today, so they will notice I am gone. They will see my blood here and piece everything together!"
"The guards are all fools! They let the Emperor die, and they'll let you die as well."
This artifact from Morrowind has a very unique ability. The dark Elves really had a sick sense of torture.
Courier! About time you showed up! I need your help with Lavasir. The fool set us up!
He has been shipping illegal packages in YOUR name!
"If we don't kill him, he'll spill everything to the guards, and the evidence he's planted cannot be ignored!"
"He's paralyzed. Let's bury him, and be done with it."
"I'm glad you decided to help. Don't worry about anything, a few bribes here and there, and the Guard will be ours."
"Meanwhile, I have found Lavasir's contracts in the other provinces. They've agreed to ship to me instead."
I'll let you in since you helped me out. How does 20% sound? I believe that amounts to 1000 gold a week.
Come see me about profits once every week for a payout. You deserve it.
"I'm promoting you to Manager of Quality Control. Don't worry, you won't have to do anything extra. You can, of course, keep delivering packages."
"I'll also get an old friend of mine to run the Anvil Branch. Keep on delivering packages, and we'll all be fine."
Thank you. Thank you so much for helping me! I... I can't believe he found out.
I helped cover up something similar to this years ago. I could not make the same choice you did.
"When I found out that he had you delivering the same special deliveries, I had to do something. So I informed the Guard about Goldhorn."
"They were trying to make a case against him, and I managed to steal one of the packages from one of the crates."
"The Guard immediately offered me protection, but I declined. I wanted to take him down myself."
He showed up at the Anvil Branch. I saw him enter the door and... I knew what was going to happen.
"I scribbled his name on the board, and stepped in to confront him, that's why he hit me on the head. I was out until we arrived here."
He grilled me for a few hours and then he used his artifact on me. Thank the Nine you showed up. I thought I was surely dead.
Don't worry about what happened to Goldhorn. He deserved what he got.
I believe we can let the Guards know. I'm sure they'll let the matter go. Justice was served.
"I'm sure I can convince the others to make you the owner of the Gold Horse Courier. You helped save its name, after all."
"Don't worry about management, I can manage it for you. And I have a friend in Hammerfell who can manage the Anvil Branch."
"And with Goldhorn out of the picture, we can start sharing the profits with all of our managers. Once a week, you can collect some of the profits."
"If you can, help me clean all this up. We'll take his body to the Guards."
Thanks again. Everything is back to normal. You can keep delivering packages as usual if you have the time. Don't forget about the weekly payouts.
"Oh, so you heard our little conversation. No matter - will you help or not?"
"Excellent. I knew I could count on you. I'll grab the shovel, you start prying up stones."
I think you are a bit short on gold.
"Very well! Now that you have an account, you can visit any Gold Horse Courier branch outside the Imperial City or Leyawiin to gain access to your money."
What can I do for you now?
Maybe another time then! Your gold is always welcome!
Opening an account costs a mere 50 gold as a one time fee. What do you say?
"If you don't already have an account, please speak to Cornelius in his office upstairs."
Opening an account costs a mere 50 gold as a one time fee. Shall I start the paperwork now?
"Hm, let me have a look in my book..."
"I can check that for you right now, let me have a look in my book..."

Feel free to report him to the city guard if he's been bothering you!
"Blah, blah, blah. Yes, our family has been here for a few thousand years, the good ones as well as the useless relatives."
Ah! So you've already met my [QUOTE]sire rambling[QUOTE] blood relative!
"Yes, his shop is pretty good. I'm there regularly to look at the latest axe models."
Someone tried to break into his house once. It was quite a sad story.
There wasn't even enough left of him to put on a stake.
You can buy or sell just about anything with him. A few people supposedly sold their souls there.
Be warned. He buys everything. Even parts of you that you can't see.
You better keep away from him and his sister. You best buy from humans here.
You will hardly find a better trader than Ma Syd Jun. And his shop always has that certain something an adventurer can expect.
"Yes, this Ma Syd Jun has a sister. However, a small mistake happened to me. The two look so alike..."
"In any case, they are both very dark in the face. And then I got them mixed up. But that happens even in the best of families."
Ma Syd Jun has a sister who is just as crazy as he is. I have no idea what they want here in town!
Ma Syd Jun? Yes. Why don't you go and bargain a little with him. Have fun! Too bad we won't see each other again!
"Ygor? Do you know Ygor? Ygor is funny, he'll make you laugh!"
He told me that joke about the...
No. It was about... wait.
"Three elves go into an orcish pub. And one orders a glass of water. No... wait, he..."
He orders a beer!
"And the other, who is a dark elf orders... a beer, too."
"No, no, wait! Let me start again. Uhm. So three orcs went into an elvish pub and one orders a beer."
Hey! Are you still listening?
Sire. I don't understand the jokes that Ygor tells!
Ygor would even make a Daedra laugh.
"Actually, my jokes are a lot funnier. But I stopped telling them because I always messed up the punch lines."
"Ygor? By the gods. When he shows up here, he babbles out one customer after the next. Believe me, this isn't even funny anymore!"
Ygor and I went on adventures together when we were young. Or was that someone else? His name started with an [QUOTE]E[QUOTE]?
Ah! Sire is in the mood for distraction. Sire! You don't discuss things like that with me!
"I'm going to tell you something shocking now! There are two types of beings, male and female. Now guess which one I belong to?"
I guess you're not from here. The 'Red Mare' is just across from the Mara Chapel. Or was that a joke?
"Of course I knew there was something special in that house, I wouldn't have entered it otherwise. An adventurer with my reputation! Ha!"
"No, of course I didn't fall asleep before making love. It was just so amazing I can't even remember it!"
"Sire, you heard the rumor that Marwen allegedly beat up a merchant for selling forbidden goods, sire?!"
"It's not true, sire. He impaled the merchant!"
"Some cities have the Legion, sire. Others have laws. We have Marwen."
"Marwen? Marwen is a good customer, sire. Are you also interested in axes?"
What about Marwen?
It's pretty nice to work in the cemetery. At least the people there don't tell you jokes all the time.
Why do I work here at the cemetery? I like gardening.
"Marwen. Marwen doesn't like outsiders. And we don't need them. I mean, this is Bravil, isn't it?"
This Marwen looks very competent.
Do you think I'm afraid of Marwen?
I'm not. I'm really not.
"Shh! Folks like us... do not talk about, you-know-who. And definitely not in public!"
"Have you found what you seek, mortal? The Blade of Namira? The Blade of Ardan?! The heart of a goddess frozen in cold steel."
Trapped within these walls over two thousand years ago. Doomed to live in cold stone.
"Steal your heart, mortal. Grab it! Fill it with blood! Let the warm living vitae glide over his blade."
"Enjoy the sound of it, which has faded away for so long. I have been enjoying your song of suffering for so long."
"Poor, poor brave hero. This sword was once made for killing. Now it leads mortals to their deaths."
There is no escape from the holy Ardan's portal. Only the oblivion of your existence. The fate of Ruun.
(Cough)
"Aradan! Nawo! Nawo. By the gods where's a mage when you need one?! Nawa, nawo, nawu, nawa. Nawa! Nawa, nawa, nawo, anum!"
Aradam! Masothar! Irrunur! Adshanat luwa riin! Masan asthurur arodil! Arodil? What nonsense! Ahum. Open up!
Uzul Aradan! Nur! Nuuur! Nuu-huuur! Damn it!
Mad fools! They feasted on the death curses. Kept the sick and dead alive until their bodies were completely rotten.
Constantly searching for the ultimate power of the gods!
The long-rotted writings said they had been destroyed under the kings that followed...
...only in truth they were swallowed up by the earth. Obliterated. At the greatest of their follies.
Bringing a god to life. To rule him and thus resurrect Ruun. Can you imagine what that would have meant?
It was in the great prayer hall that they performed the bloody ritual. But when Askot their high priest raised his arms and his voice...
"...to call into the deepest spheres between life and death, to receive the answer of the ancient Ever-Being. No portal opened. No god appeared. No voice answered."
"Instead, a sandstorm of white splinters blew across their bodies with a loud crack, ripping the flesh from their bones..."
Nobody escaped. Except for one.
"I am Oron. The last of the Mephalists. And whatever you may think of the deeds of the past, know: I have done penance for two thousand years!"
"...and sheltered the book of the last wisdom of Ruun's arcane knowledge, so that never again, will history repeat itself."
"The Bloodscript is the last knowledge of the Mephalists, and it hides the dance that brought them down."
Can you imagine what might happen if this work fell into forbidden hands?
So. Even if you don't speak the language of the ancients. Those who can are far more dangerous than you!
That's it! By Mephala! The Bloodscript! And it's almost entirely soaked through? What have you done with it?
"Well. It doesn't matter, let that be my concern. Oh yes. Didn't you have one more wish?"
You've handed it to your master. And Oron will not trade it for some shiny coins. You don't have the smallest clue what real arcane forces are buried beneath these dangerous lines.
Oron has it. I wouldn't be here otherwise!
How can you be so stupid? For over two thousand years I managed to hide the temple from the eyes of mortals and do penance!
And then you come and find Auril's Rhyme and give the Scripts to Oron too! You let yourself be abused like a cheap whore!
"Yes, take the book with you. I know you can't read it. And you fought bravely...."
"And if you will take it to an old friend of mine in Bravil, I think he would be quite interested that you have it."
Come on! Let's leave this dark place forever!
Bloodscripts? You forget you are speaking to a man of the law. Either you used yours or someone else's blood for ink and wrote a whole book with it and now ask me what I think about that? Are you serious?!
"Ah, sire has the bloody book. Well sire, maybe now you'll be ready for the Final Trial, and will close the final chapter of Ruun!"
"I am Nanya of Vl穗or, the last survivor of the Mephalists. I think Oron will have told you about me already!"
Wise words. And where should we look? He could have hidden the book all over Tamriel?
"The Halls of Ln? Are you sure? It's an old arcane academy, nearly as old as Ruun itself. But if he wants to open a gate to the spheres it would be just the right spot to visit. Follow me!"
It's a ruin. But once upon a time it was the Arcane Halls of Ln.
Long before the 'Nine'. Ardan 'the Bloody' dedicated them to their downfall by betraying the Daedra.
"How do you like this daughter of Daedra, Oron?!"
"Nanya of Vl穗or! The penitent! The killer of hundreds of innocent souls! After this long game of cat and mouse, let's meet!"
"The price your father paid for his betrayal will be yours, twice over in revenge for your betrayal of the cult of Mephala. You should know better your highness! I won't hesitate like that fool, to stick in the blade if your body is so willingly offered!"
This blade has shed more blood than you have venom on your tongue! And it will be a pleasure for me to wash that away with your blood!

"As dead as your innocence, I'd say. And you have played no small part in it."
Aaaaah! Damn it! How can this be! I curse you! You and all of your descendants! Should your children survive their births...
"Oh yeah, Bravil isn't a pretty spot for a girl like me. But where does a hero ever come and rescue you?"
I know who you are. And I have to admit you look a lot prettier than in the stories.
"Hmm, you're cute."
Oh. Do you say this to all your admirers?
Oh please. You are flattering me.
I can't let this opportunity pass me by... But follow me quietly!
Oh. So I guess I have to live on in my misery.
"Oh! Have you heard your little heart, my noble knight? Did you honestly think you could set me free? Is it still beating in time with courage?"
"Well, the flow of water from the spring to the Imperial City has been disturbed by something."
"I don't know what it is, and due to my ailments it would not be wise for me to leave the comfort of my home."
"It is most likely nothing major, probably just a heap of rubble and other debris caught on the stonework."
I don't know what else could block it.
It would be a great service to the people of the Imperial City if you would bless us with this great deed.
All you need to do is walk along the aqueducts and try to find whatever it is blocking off the flow of water.
It shouldn't prove very difficult to one of your stature.
"Okay, just walk along the aqueducts until you see something blocking the path, then remove whatever the blockage is."
That's all you have to do.
Perhaps I could offer you a small amount of gold from the Office of Commerce if they commission your deeds.
"I am Vabvam Drothan, Imperial Water Worker, glad to be at your service."
"The aqueducts were created by the will of Tiber Septim, during a time when the Imperial City's water supply was running very low..."
"...therefore, building this monumental structure was the most effective choice."
"I, like my fathers before me, have been assigned the task of maintaining the structural integrity of this fine work of masonry."
"There are other details, but they are not of great importance."
"They are technical details about the infrastructure of the aqueducts, which you are likely to not understand."
Therefore I do not see the point in wasting my breath to tell you.
"Okay, come back to me when you have cleared it."
"Well you can't have cleared everything, go back and finish what you have started."
"Ah, yes... Perhaps the blockage is somewhere within the Water Works. Here, you can keep this key."
A note? What does it say?
A death wish you say? By the Dark Brotherhood maybe?
"The Mockers you say? I have not heard that name for quite some time, but I do remember an issue of the Black Horse Courier mentioning them."
It was about some extravagant plot to use the Thieves Guild as a puppet to control the actions of the Imperial Watch.
It was all a bit ridiculous if you ask me. I don't even believe the Thieves Guild really exists.
"Anyway, thank you for your help, here is the reward I promised you."
"No, thank you. Without your help the people of the Imperial City would be without water, something I wish to never witness again."
"Yes, the herbs always do the trick."
